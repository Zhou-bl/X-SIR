This helps me point out whether any parameters are out of whack. However, this is not really validated unless you apply it to a new workout, so if they change any of my intensity/volume/workout or performance variables, you may want them to go back and do a Load Test using your own spreadsheet instead.\nThanks, Matt and Pedro.
