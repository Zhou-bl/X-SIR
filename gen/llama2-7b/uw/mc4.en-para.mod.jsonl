{"prompt": "Study says horses 'talk' to other horses with ears,", "response": "The common belief that horses are unintelligent animals is incorrect, as recent research suggests that they communicate more through their ears than through vocal sounds. A study published in Nature Communications revealed that horses use the hearing areas of their skulls to process threatening events and construct detailed acoustic structures. Despite having fewer neurons in their brains compared to cats, dogs, and chickens, horses' cautious reactions to threats may have led to the misconception of their intelligence. This behavior indicates that horses process sounds dominantly, allowing them to decode information and avoid potential dangers. Rather than displaying bravado, their fidgety behavior serves as a warning mechanism to protect them from predators."}

The basic induction hob consists of a large arc that emits high temperatures, which in turn powers the cooking and heating elements. The temperature is determined by the thermal capacity of the hob, which can be either chamber-free or unconstrained. This allows cooks to control the heat power according to their needs."}
