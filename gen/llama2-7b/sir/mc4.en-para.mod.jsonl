These concerns were raised by missionaries who had traveled throughout rural areas in China during the 1800s and documented these injustices to advocate for increased Christian missionary work. Their reports were published and widely read in the West, leading to a growing awareness of the exploitation in the Chinese art trade. Despite these efforts, Western nations continued to import art from China, likely contributing to the widespread exploitation of labor."}

These events were not just about gas, but also about life, human frailty, greed, power, trust, leadership, democracy, and much more. Although I may be too old to remember 9/11, I still recall the panic it caused and the understandable reactions it evoked in people at that time."}

Where was the influence of science in their decision? The answer does not lie in discrediting or disqualifying their knowledge; if their understanding is limited, it has still served them well. Their vote alone did not grant political authorization for an executive order prohibiting Muslims from entering the country. It is evident that this executive was empowered by the votes of other Americans who distrusted and disagreed with their more knowledgeable colleagues.

{"prompt": "Theory classes: The seminars for this subject were held before", "response": "In the second experiment, I found the contents to be very interesting and they helped me understand some basic concepts of solid-state physics. However, in the first experiment, my lab team and I struggled to understand a small sample in a short amount of time, which affected our ability to prepare an adequate data sheet for our results. Additionally, difficulties with the instrument's calibration procedure led to a lower performance, and I was unable to make a significant contribution to our team's results. This practical session was crucial as it accounted for 60% of our professor's assigned grades. Working on two separate samples during the session resulted in two distinct experimental conditions, leading to four distinctive results instead of just one. From this experience, I learned the importance of being better organized when taking samples from a crystal, using a sharp pencil tip for sample positioning and a razor blade for proper cutting."}
