{"prompt": "Of course they say that, Bright Pebbles. But what", "response": " is \"real?\"\nThere’s nothing real to a memory. They’re just chemical and biological processes — electrical pulses and hormone spikes associated with specific life events — triggered by external stimuli. But our minds do their best to reconstruct and reanimate past experiences when we revisit them, and that’s really all people mean when they talk about remembering a “vivid memory.” Those memories become real by association with other thoughts, sensations, and emotions, all anchored back into reality by the knowledge that they’re part of a person’s history.\nSo if we can simulate those feelings — by re-creating a place or a character or an object as it was at a particular point in time — we can use that knowledge to anchor those experiences in a person’ s reality just as strongly as if they were truly seeing the thing in person again. And sometimes, such simulations can even create new memories that, if repeated enough times"}

{"prompt": "Lesson 29: Why Did Jesus Weep? in Dr Fountain'", "response": "s Corner\nI will learn why Jesus wept.\nJesus’ family tried to take him home because they said He was “mad” or “out of His mind.” He wanted them to go and prepare for His death the way everyone else had done, but they didn’t follow His instructions because they were already trying to do everything themselves. The result was that their own sorrow took precedence. They couldn’t be there with Him when He needed them. This was a common theme for me with my brothers from a long-standing family history filled with issues similar to these (the need for help is constant regardless of one’s maturity).\nSo, it’s this issue of sorrow and self-centeredness that needs to be worked-out. I realized that my sorrow was based upon what I wanted for others and was filled with self-loathing and guilt. I don’t know why it’s so, perhaps a reflection on what has been given"}

{"prompt": "The Museum Outlet - Laguna Rocks, Low Tide, 1915-", "response": "23\nChinese-made reproductions including Chinese antiquities and copies of old master paintings have long enjoyed a role in Western European art education and collecting. By the turn of the 20th century, however, their manufacture in China had come to be understood by many observers as an industry founded upon slavery and forced labour among the country’s lower classes. Such fears about the relationship between local labourers and foreign buyers in the art trade came directly from missionaries who travelled throughout rural areas during their 1800s stay in China and made note of these inequities to back up rhetorical arguments for increased Christian missionary activity from abroad. These attributions appeared on mission-produced publications and were further spread by those who read such works in the West and found their contents convincing and justifiable. However, despite such efforts by Christian organisations, Western nations continued importing art from China that very likely did involve widespread"}

{"prompt": "Vintage 1980's Jaeger Size 10 Camel Jumper | Oxfam ", "response": "95% Wool / 5% Nylon. Perfect for cocktail dresses and winter parties.\nThis is a very cocolate brown colour and a luxurious thick woollen jumper with lovely silk like details and ribbon around the sleeves and a gorgeous gold foiled Jaeger label. There are three/four small stains but nothing that can be seen once worn. The cuff's have also been slightly remade so you don't see where, I will just put a few bits of tape on when posting as I don't think they look too bad. Only reason for selling is because I have bought a bigger size so would fit an HR to XS person depending on shape! I would probably guess an M to a larger L size so a smaller sized person up to a larger curvaceous lady's size 16 would fit as long as they don't have too"}

With such a diverse group around the table and lots of research updates, we were able to have a great evening catching up on everyone around GRASP and seeing their exciting work! Thanks again to"}
{"prompt": "One of the most underrated products in a man’s ", "response": "45 and older tool kit, is a pair of scissors. These little gems can perform wonders in your skin care regime and I was thrilled when I found The Perfect Tool at a local craft fair, which seemed to be a perfect match for me because they’re based right here in Western Australia (my home state).\nWhen I first saw The Perfect Scissor, I found myself wondering if any one man would have two heads, two opposable thumbs, and be as precise and skilful at precision as to be able to create such a phenomenal instrument that works so well, I almost didn’t believe they were real at all. There must be people out there, if I could manage to become an orthopaedic surgeon or anything with “-trict” in it, I might be a part of these people … just saying.\nI took these beauties home and with a pair of tweezers made at the Boab Tree in"}
{"prompt": "Theory classes: The seminars for this subject were held before", "response": " the second experiment. The contents were very interesting and helped me to understand some basic concepts of solid-state physics.\nExperiment I: It was very hard for me and my lab team to understand such a small sample in a few hours to prepare an adequate data sheet for our results. Besides, having some difficulties with the instrument’s calibration procedure lead me to have a low level on performance and I could not make an important contribution to our entire team results. This practical session was very important since we had to realize a 60% from the grades assigned by our professor. As I worked on two separate samples during the session, each one yielded two distinct experimental conditions, which made their study a bit complicated since we ended up with four distinctive results instead of just one. A very important point to note from this experience was to be better organized when taking samples from a crystal sample using a sharp pencil tip for sample position and use a razor blade to cut a proper"}
