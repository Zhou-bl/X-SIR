{"prompt": "Study says horses 'talk' to other horses with ears,", "response": " neck\nPrevious studies have shown that horse communication is achieved by facial expressions and tapping the ground with feet; however according to new studies conducted by University of Liverpool researchers communication may occur via body posture. The research team noted that the horse's ears can send over 150 precise messages from one horse to another that they never actually see. In fact the study states that this type of communication can even affect the behaviors of animals at a different location who are exposed to it through radio frequencies. The team also claims to have found a way for humans to read into these ear signal communications effectively by observing small changes in the horses' ears called the parotoid gland which changes its shape when alerting others to its distress state. Scientists said this sort of body communication can inform others of danger within its environment in order to elicit a protective action towards the individual in pain from the herd or flock.

{"prompt": "Статьи | Market Forex - Part 5\nYou", "response": " may be thinking now, \"Why did I want to learn this if the news is already out on the forums or in the paper?\" The answer lies in that the forums and the paper don't give you the big picture on the news. If the news really wasn't that great for the U.S.A., the forums will have news about the situation and you want to know whether there are major upcoming problems now. From personal experience, the worst losses can happen on good news because you miss profits. On the other hand, if the news said that the GDP has fallen to 2.6 for example from the previous quarter of (say) 4.1 (the difference between the levels of growth), it doesn't tell you if the markets will keep falling.

That said the audience was largely populated by Norwegians.

I thought the Bush Family was an unqualified, feckless failure. This does not change the fact that Republicans have a lot of ideas related to crime and education that should be fought for. The bad side to this, of course, is that Republicans like Perry always seem to support these ideas while actually acting in a way exactly opposing these goals by supporting crony capitalism and the wealthy, and the education of public employee children via vouchers and a lack of transparency.

I will cover passive authentication later because it hasn't always been available in the configurations I've looked at.\nSometimes passive authentication isn't desirable. If you are configuring an authentication method that can only be satisfied through knowledge alone (something you know), you will want to store the authentication factors away from an attacker because that's a form of passive authentication.
