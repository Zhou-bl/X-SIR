For the first time since Cristiano Ronaldo moved to Madrid from Sporting Lisbon they may actually get a proper challenge in their bid to win La Liga and lift a Champions League trophy this season. In his press conference today Guardiola cited the return of Thibault Courtois from his failed year at Chelsea as proof that Los Merengue are capable of being a threat more than ever before. So whilst many will be worried by those rumours regarding Sergio Ramos' desire to leave after so much recent unhappiness in Camp Nou and the constant rumours linking Carvalho's future to a possible switch to London. Despite all of both clubs wanting every last part of a perfect season, I believe Barca should not panic about such whisperings and remain strong mentally. There is little room now for any serious injury problems affecting either side. All in all, there is everything set up for one of Jose Mourinho's"}

{"prompt": "polyethylene glycol 8000 | Psychiatric Drugs | Antidepressants | Antipsychotics", "response": "\nGlycine is probably best known as an essential component of protein synthesis and the neurotransmitter glutamate in neurons. In other non-neuronal tissues, it acts primarily as a neurotrophin with anti-proliferative function. For example, its action on lymphocytes protects them from cell-killing damage while stimulating their production [9]. Its effects are related to several mechanisms: direct stimulation or inhibition (or both) of various cell types; facilitation or prevention of degradation through proteolytic processes; induction or antagonism of receptors for hormones (e.g. insulin), cytokines or neurotransmitters; suppression or enhancement of nitric oxide synthase activity; stimulation or inactivation of endoglucanases involved in sugar utilization etc. There is no doubt that many others remain to be identified [16], because even if we now have convincing data implicating glycine on brain function there may be more than one mechanism explaining at least"}

It is so big and beautiful in my opinion as well, I love the many details on one page for instance when all of those dwarves suddenly appear at their own side of the bridge and you can see their legs right below under the snow pile. And there was also some very interesting design work on that one scene with the people from around the lake coming together to help rescue their missing lord by lighting torches at his huts or something like this. It's a perfect example of what is possible in your maps when using \"real world\" objects mixed in there. You didn't make all of it up ;you have used reality and just embellished them with style and great looking tiles. Your scenes look real because they are real in one way or another :) Nice job and keep doing what you enjoy!\nTerrific interpretation of a familiar scene re-inkept here with an eye toward making it fit together with"}

Salting\nWASHINGTON (BPN) - Scientists for decades have debated whether there is a universal language used in conversation among horses or if they respond to different signals from nostrils to tail from each of the seven million domestic breed varieties in America. Now an international team of researchers based at Stanford University in California will begin conducting tests on up to 20 Spanish-bred Andalusian thoroughbreds imported to the U.S. to see if scientists can find some clues in their response to sounds coming from around them via both their ear and hind quarters. The investigation is expected to launch next month on two farms under cover of nightfall when test participants are put into viewing booths facing one another about 48 feet away. Each participant will be equipped with microphones to determine whether hearing a certain sound makes his rear end move forward to approach another horse before he has been turned loose from his confinement by"}

I understand that for now there is not really any alternative to the internal combustion engine vehicles and if such alternative came up before it hits mainstream cars become pretty costly and hard to adapt cars with current components and safety standards (for example airbags), so currently we can use new things to try new products rather than using old cars for mass changes into new automotive future.

It's not like you go \"You're gonna lose an kidney today\" or something - most hospitals use a numerical scale used to measure pain and it's called a scale with five increments. Don't know if there's any point in creating new measures because all it does is become another thing people memorise - I bet my pain was nine before we took off for France and when we landed it had dropped to a six, then on arrival was now a ten...and nobody's counting. And if they don't do the twelve-point scale anymore at least call them by their old names; for example I may give up and surrender to the fact that nobody can come up with a word for \"My leg hurts\" so now I tend to just say \"Ouch\" instead.

{"prompt": "How A Bad Employer Can Traumatize Workers For Life -", "response": " Forbes\nThe job offers a high-paying entry-level position to college graduates with promising careers. But not all is as crystal clear and green as it sounds: the jobs require work hours and shifts that are imposable for those with a healthy diet or balanced schedule. The employer also doesn't disclose if he will offer benefits. And there are no medical procedures in place to handle employee illness. This employer doesn't adhere to workplace safety standards, even after being accused of negligence more than once by concerned health and labor departments. And when things get rough on home (for example, being trapped underground because his co-workers don't show up and leaving his wife hungry), his employers don't give him time off, just another hard shift without pay. When this worker suffers from exposure-related diseases following working conditions for too long with this employer, his employer abandons responsibility to compensate; so this man can neither financially survive nor afford healthcare to heal.

{"prompt": "Perfume Kenzo Perfume Tao yuan - cologne and fragrance Tao", "response": ".\nTao (a transliteration of the Mandarin phrase) means way or truth. There are many theories as to its origins. It is generally believed that it grew out of a religious sect which originated in China some time before Christianity began. The followers were called Wayists because they believed in one true, all encompassing God. After its exposure through missionary activity to people who had never heard of it, this monotheistic religion spread across Europe about two thousand years ago. When Christians started calling it Taoism, there was no distinction made between it and Buddhism by any educated person since both cultures regarded it with equal disdain. Both religions believed their own way was the only true way. Hence, Taoist beliefs became more and more fused with those of other religious faiths. Today's Taoism is a blend of all faiths and most particularly an amalgamation of ancient Eastern traditions and Western religious philosophy and science. Therefore today's Taoists consider themselves at one with Christ if not actually Christian. Tao"}

{"prompt": "Induction cooktops create heat from magnetic energy. This energy ", "response": " which is transferred to each surface of your cooking vessel  is much more uniform and produces far less hot spots than conventional gas cookers. Thats because electric coils can be precisely controlled to generate heat at almost any level without compromising a consistently high cooking temperature, explains Kannan Gopinathan (pictured), GE Indias senior vice president for appliances. The technology also ensures zero smoke or burning odours in kitchens when you cook.\nCooking with an induction hob does not only save electricity; it also makes your dishes tastier! Induction pans set to a simmer mode will give food an unmistakable aroma and taste by heating water vapor around its edges. With a convection mode on, meanwhile, your items will be crisp and fried to perfection if you wish. It makes cooking faster too: Food will only get heated up around surfaces where its actually touching the pan. As a result, there is no time-consuming pre-warming step and virtually no wastage, Gopinathan notes.\n"}

It's nice to have multiple people doing what they do best so there isn't constant communication which also helps relieve some stress. The team was friendly and it didn't feel like a typical corporate environment when I first went there. There were many conversations about things besides work even if it does take up most of our time whether that be movie quotes or current news.

Whether it's china, silver, watches, crystal and glassware, jewelry, ceramics ... then you should certainly read on. Melbourne is one of Australia's great cities which is famous for its numerous antiques and other items of collectabel interest.

{"prompt": "Institution: Committee on National Statistics\nPrincipal Investigator: Connie Citro\n", "response": "Project Description: This project will examine the role of human capital and social capital in job quality and worker productivity. Specifically, there is a considerable amount of mixed evidence regarding whether social context is associated with different labor market outcomes. Further complicating this issue is that much of the existing work does not provide sufficiently fine-grained measures of context to distinguish between specific aspects for which we would typically expect variation to matter (e.g., neighborhood type). Thus both theoretical and empirical literatures point toward a more nuanced view about how context matters and suggest future research is needed to address those issues. First, the project will use nationally representative data from a monthly survey collected quarterly from employers conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics-Contingenta Employee Survey to examine differences among workers based on industry, occupation and other characteristics related to workers' earnings and job quality. Second, using similar data and variables generated from the BLS quarterly survey, we plan to conduct an experiment (e.o.a. 1.C.7"}
