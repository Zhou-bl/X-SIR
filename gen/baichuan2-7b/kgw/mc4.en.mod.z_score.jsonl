UDP implementation goes beyond this, though, and involves a wide range of more immediate actions tackling urban issues through specific investment projects and/or the deployment of some direct funding instruments. This means that UDP has become an important vehicle for action across all scales and levels to address Europe’s challenges and its future prospects. It should be noted here that European member states are also increasingly engaging with these issues, adopting different national approaches, implementing their very own policies for addressing urban needs and expectations and enhancing the role of cities within them.
