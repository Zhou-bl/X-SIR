The transfer to the US was a \"rescue mission,\" Dallas Zoo President Gregg Hudson says, because the elephants were slated to be killed to make room for rhinos at the Big Game Parks reserve in Swaziland, which is suffering a \"state-of-emergency drought.\" Activists, however, aren't happy. Connecticut-based Friends of Animals, which had filed for a preliminary injunction, was planning to make legal arguments \"to prevent a lifetime of captivity\" for the elephants during a Thursday hearing. Scoffs Hudson, \"There are those who would rather see elephants die than live in accredited zoos. We strongly disagree.\" In a statement, Friends of Animals accuses the \"devious\" zoos of \"secretly\" removing the elephants ahead of the hearing, writing, \"the underhandedness of this move cannot be overstated.\" The group contends that confining elephants in zoos can cause depression and other psychological problems. In a statement of its own, the Dallas Zoo calls claims that the elephants were taken from Swaziland under cover of darkness \"outlandish,\" adding that the transfer had been planned for months and \"there was no subterfuge.\" The US Fish and Wildlife Service approved the transfer in January. Also, the zoo notes, the preliminary injunction did not prohibit the relocation from going forward. The elephants, which were sedated and put into crates for the flight, range in age from 6 years old to 25. In exchange for the animals, the zoos will donate money toward the game reserve's rhino conservation program."

A team from Yale University found that a gene called MPK-1 is twice as active in those who suffer from depression. The gene works as an \"off-switch,\" they say, controlling a \"cascade\" of chemicals needed for healthy brain function, the AFP notes. \"This could be a primary cause, or at least a major contributing factor, to the signaling abnormalities that lead to depression,\" the study's lead author tells the Telegraph.

La la la!,\" writes Seitz. The Loony Tunes short is a true “mind-effer.” Fantasia (1940): Come on, dancing mushrooms? The psychedelic combo of instrumental music and choreographed animation—both dramatically horrifying and playfully silly—was probably pretty wicked for kids at the time. Yellow Submarine (1968): Another popular animation set to music, this movie follows the Fab Four on a journey to restore color to Pepperland…and that’s essentially all the plot you’ll find. The rest is stunning visual imagery to accompany Beatles’ classics like “Eleanor Rigby” and “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.” Inland Empire (2006): This list wouldn’t truly be trippy without infamous surreal director David Lynch. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968): Stanley Kubrick’s sci-fi classic, \"a parable of evolution and the limits of imagination,\" plays with the mind’s concept of space, time, and human existence. After 43 years, it still lives up to its original promo, “The ultimate trip.” See the other trippy classics that made the list."

US District Court Judge Arenda Wright Allen on Tuesday declined the Gloucester County School Board's request to dismiss the case.

Grimm sued in 2015, claiming the policy violated his constitutional rights as well as federal protections against sex discrimination. The Supreme Court last year declined to hear the case and sent it back to a lower court. In September, the school board argued that the case should be dismissed. \"I feel an incredible sense of relief,\" Grimm said in a statement Tuesday. \"After fighting this policy since I was 15 years old, I finally have a court decision saying that what the Gloucester County School Board did to me was wrong and it was against the law.

The results from Finland contradict decades of thinking about the best way to treat an inflamed appendix. The condition has long been thought to be a medical emergency because of the risk for a burst appendix, which can be life-threatening. But advances in imaging tests make it easy to determine which patients face that danger. The study in 500 adults found that nearly two-thirds of patients treated with antibiotics fared well after five years. About one-third had another case of appendicitis and had surgery to take out their appendix. \"How should these results influence clinical decision-making?\" asks Edward Livingston in the study, published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. He explains that patients with acute uncomplicated appendicitis can choose to have surgery—which has \"relatively few major complications\" and the advantage of \"removing the source of the disease\"—or opt for antibiotics, which pose \"little risk\" and only a 39% chance of the appendicitis recurring over five years."

The 2015 Columbia University grad was found dead Sunday afternoon on the country's Bastimentos Island. Now the New York Daily News cites Panama's La Prensa in reporting an initial autopsy suggests she was strangled. The Edgemont, New York, native was last seen Thursday morning. The Briarcliff Daily Voice reports she had planned to leave Colon Island, where she was staying, to go to Red Frog Beach on Bastimentos for the day; authorities were alerted when she didn't return to her hostel, and her body was found by a police officer days later in a wooded area near Bastimentos' shore. The Daily News calls Johannet a \"globetrotting Scarsdale woman,\" and her brother Paul elaborates on that in a Facebook post. \"She was a world traveler—by the age of 23, she had already visited 6 continents and innumerable countries, including a recent 18-month trip to Vietnam where she taught English Literature to local students.\" Panamanian investigators, in concert with the FBI, on Tuesday conducted raids on the area as part of their investigation, though no details have been given regarding them or whether there are any suspects. Adds brother Paul, \"She was cheerful, adventurous, thoughtful and warm—all qualities I strive towards. I'll always look up to my youngest sister.\" (A teen confessed on Monday to killing an American tourist in London.)"

Out of nearly 90 million pounds of electronic equipment it recovered last year, 61 million pounds were recycled, Apple reports. Specifically, it reclaimed 23 million pounds of steel; 13 million pounds of plastic; 12 million pounds of glass; 4.5 million pounds of aluminum; 3 million pounds of copper; 6,600 pounds of silver; and 2,200 pounds of gold. That amounts to $1.7 million worth of silver, $6.5 million of copper—and a whopping $43 million in gold, reports Quartz. Activist group Fairphone, which watches electronics supply chains, notes that a typical smartphone contains 30 milligrams of gold, mainly in circuit boards and other internal components, reports Business Insider. It's not a lot, but spread across millions of phones and other electronics, it adds up. CNNMoney reports that while it's pricey, gold is a popular choice in consumer electronics for being corrosion resistant yet excellent at conducting electricity. (Silver is a superior conductor but corrodes easily.) In March, Apple unveiled an experimental bot called Liam, which can disassemble an iPhone in 11 seconds and sort its parts for recycling. Prototypes are already at work, and the line is designed to take apart 1.2 million phones a year. \"It's an experiment in recycling technology, and we hope this kind of thinking will inspire others,\" Apple notes.

Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff on Tuesday said the South Korean and US militaries were analyzing the launch and the South Korean military said the projectile traveled 1678 miles with a height of 341 miles. Japanese officials said the missile flew over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido and landed in the Pacific Ocean. There was no damage to ships or anything else reported. Japan's NHK TV said the missile separated into three parts. The launch comes days after the North fired what was assessed as three short-range ballistic missiles into the sea and a month after its second flight test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, which analysts say could reach deep into the US mainland when perfected. North Korea typically reacts with anger to US-South Korean military drills, which are happening now, often staging weapons tests and releasing threats to Seoul and Washington in its state-controlled media. But animosity is higher than usual following threats by US President Donald Trump to unleash \"fire and fury\" on the North, and Pyongyang's stated plan to consider firing some of its missiles toward Guam."

Clients will be picked up in a car (also from Uber) and taken to and from the helipad; anyone in the area with the Uber app can call a copter. Past tests were pretty pricey: The Verge reports rides have so far cost a minimum of several hundred bucks, with the Hamptons rides costing $3,000 each. In this case, Uber tells the Los Angeles Times that 15-minute rides to and from Park City, Utah, and the Salt Lake City airport will cost $200 per person during the day and $300 at night.

That's probably because zinc (pennies are made mostly of zinc, with a small amount of copper) has been rising in price.

He conceded that Rosier's crimes were serious, \"but when you look at the range of punishments available, that's why they call it juvenile.\" Ultimately, Rosier's sentence resulted from convictions on three felony counts: cruelty to animals with a firearm, burglary of a dwelling with a firearm, and shooting into a building. \"A gun in a 16-year-old's hand can do equally the damage as a gun in an adult's hand,\" said the prosecuting attorney. \"He's not a child.\" The trooper, Boody, cried when testifying about how he came home to find his dog crippled by gunshot wounds.

Researchers looked at three labor-force surveys from the US and Europe to find out how many hours a person works, on average, in various countries. They found that Americans work an average of 1,353 hours per year, the highest number of the 19 countries studied, Fortune reports. Compare that to Italy, where each person only works an average of 960 hours per year, the lowest number of hours of any country studied. Americans are also retiring later, taking less vacation time, and, as Quartz reports, are more likely to work odd hours, such as the middle of the night or weekends. As recently as the early 1970s, US and Western European workers actually clocked about the same number of hours, Bloomberg reports. It's not clear what's changed or how to account for the discrepancy, but some economists point to the fact that there's more incentive to work harder for a promotion in the US, because people earn a wider range of incomes there than in Europe, so it's more likely they'll get a significant raise. There's also the fact that taxes are significantly higher in Europe, meaning that there's less of an incentive to work more hours and earn more money that will be taxed. Finally, there's the fact that labor unions and worker protections are stronger in Europe, and pensions are more generous there."

Investors ended up suing the company building the ship, and the company lost; it was ordered to pay $800,000 in legal costs but allegedly never did, so now the investors are going after people who purchased the condos—including, in TMZ's telling, Boone, hence the court appearance. But Boone says he was nothing more than a celebrity spokesman for the would-be ship, and he doesn't seem too concerned about the whole thing, saying he does plan to get himself to court and telling TMZ, \"Is this the way Lindsay Lohan and Robert Downey got so famous?\""

Instead, per an Ohio State Highway Patrol press release, 31-year-old Daniel Yates apparently decided to cross state lines with these \"gifts\" in the trunk of a rented 2016 Ford Expedition, and when he was pulled over Monday morning for driving too closely, a drug-sniffing police dog alerted its human colleagues to Yates' cargo. Yates was charged with the felonies of possession and trafficking in drugs, which could net him up to a $30,000 fine and up to 16 years in prison if he's convicted.

The $546 figure comes from the bill of a woman who spent three days in the same hospital, which paid $5.16 for her six liters of saline. Bernstein acknowledges we're pretty numb to the reality of inflated health-care costs, but sees something more in \"the tale of the humble IV bag\": \"secrecy that helps keep prices high.\" It's the product of purchasing organizations and distributors and other players who make deals that \"so obscure prices and profits that even participants cannot say what the simplest component of care actually costs, let alone what it should cost,\" she writes. \"And that leaves taxpayers and patients alike with an inflated bottom line and little or no way to challenge it.\" Read her full piece here."

Mercedes offers so many options for its vehicles (such as four types of caps for the tire valves in the case of its S-Class sedan), it's \"too much ... for the machines,\" the company's head of production tells Bloomberg. “Robots can’t deal with the degree of individualization,\" Markus Schaefer continues. \"We’re saving money and safeguarding our future by employing more people.\" The Sindelfingen, Germany, factory produces 400,000 cars annually, and while humans can make changes to a production line in a weekend, reprogramming robots tacks on weeks, which doesn't jibe with Schaefer's push to halve the time it takes to make a car from the 61 hours it took in 2005. As far as specifics of this change go, Bloomberg points to the car maker's new E-Class, which is available beginning next month. The car's speed and navigation instructions are projected onto the windshield, and the task of aligning the display will shift in some cases from two permanent robots to a worker. Gizmodo points out that Mercedes' move does not herald the reversal of the trend that half of jobs will be automated in coming decades. (Indeed, the International Federation of Robotics reports that \"by 2018, around 1.3 million industrial robots will be entering service in factories around the world.\") \"But it’s also a timely reminder that as good as robots get, they’ve got a long way to go to beat the human machine.\""

The New York Times reports the creature with brilliantly hued plumage was first spotted Oct. 10 and has since gone viral, with spectators all vying for pictures of an animal usually seen only in East Asia. For now, the duck's origins remain a mystery: None of the city's zoos have this type of duck missing from the roster, and it's illegal in NYC to keep a duck as a pet. That means the duck perhaps escaped from, say, an owner in New Jersey and made its way to the city, or maybe the owner itself got sick of the duck and unceremoniously left it and ran. Either way, the duck has been a huge hit. \"It's just an incredible gift to New York,\" one birder tells CBS New York. Avian experts believe that based on its feeding habits—it likes bugs and vegetation skimmed from the water's surface—the duck should be able to survive just fine in the Big Apple, and park officials say they're just going to let it be unless it becomes injured. It already appears to have made friends with the park's mallards.

After her father reported messages from Sandusky to police last year, investigators discovered that he had asked the girl's sister to perform oral sex on him in 2013, when she was 13. He pleaded guilty to charges including soliciting sex from a child younger than 16. Authorities say Sandusky, a former state prison guard who knew the girls through dating their mother, tried to persuade them that what he was doing was normal, saying \"it's not weird because he studied medicine,\" but asking them not to show his messages to anybody.

A series of underground tubes will transport beer from the De Halve Maan brewery at the center of Bruges, Belgium, to a bottling plant a couple miles away. \"It all started as a joke,\" brewer Xavier Vanneste tells the Wall Street Journal. But, four years after work began, the pipeline is just weeks away from completion. The project was \"born of environmental and quality of life concerns,\" Vanneste told AFP in an earlier story. Beer has been brewed at De Halve Maan's historic site for some five centuries. The bottling end of the operation was moved to an industrial area in 2010, creating traffic issues. The pipeline will eliminate some 500 truck trips through the city's narrow, cobblestone alleyways each year. Unfortunately, rumors notwithstanding, in-home taps aren't an option for locals. Once complete, the pipeline (a \"Willy Wonkian approach\" to the traffic problem, per the Independent) will transport 1,500 gallons of beer per hour at 12mph. The $4.5 million project was, in part, crowdfunded, with donors receiving lifetime supplies of beer (one 11 ounce bottle per day or one 25 ounce bottle per year, depending on the donation amount). A local restaurateur who contributed calculated that he would regain his investment, via beer, in 15 years. But, he tells the Journal, he would have preferred a direct tap to his establishment: \"It would have saved me a lot of keg-dragging.” The mayor of Bruges is now considering pipelines to transport all kinds of things, including chocolate. As for concerns that scofflaws may try to illegally tap the beer line, which is buried at depths of six to 100 feet, Vanneste says the polyethylene tubes are stronger than steel. But, the brewer promises, the flavor of its beers will be unaffected. (Bieber's beer bong encounter ended badly.)"

They can only surmise that a cat ran across the wet tile while it was drying, sometime around 100 AD. Despite the prints, workers fired the tile, called a tegula, and popped it onto the roof of a building under construction in what is now Gloucester. The tile had been tucked away in the museum since 1969 before being spotted. “At that time the archaeologists seem to have been more interested in digging things up than looking at what they found,” the museum curator tells Discovery News.

The Los Angeles Times reports that real estate developer Mohamed Hadid was sentenced Thursday to 200 hours of service, fined $3,000, and ordered to pay the city more than $14,000 to cover building department costs. Hadid pleaded no contest in May to misdemeanor charges for building portions of a 30,000-square-foot mansion in Bel Air without obtaining proper permits, reports the AP. The Times explains that the house's height and size were in excess of what the city permits, and neighbors have complained that the structure has destabilized the hillside it sits on. Hadid has also been ordered to employ an engineer to develop a plan to stabilize the land; if that can't be done, the house may have to be razed, at an estimated cost of $1 million. Authorities say bedrooms, decks, supporting walls, and even an IMAX theater were built illegally. The city halted construction three years ago and the home remains unfinished. Hadid's attorney, Robert Shapiro, said after sentencing that Hadid is interested in bringing the home into compliance and completing it."

But \"to have a patient with spontaneous identical triplets is incredibly rare,\" says a doctor who recently delivered a set of such triplets—and puts the odds at about one in a million. Jody and Jase Kinsey of Miles City, Mont., knew that multiples were a possibility—Jase's dad was a twin—but they weren't expecting to hear, from the tech at their first ultrasound, that there appeared to be three babies in there. They soon ended up under the care of the aforementioned specialist, Dr. Dana Damron, and Jody gave birth to sons Cade, Ian, and Milo on Dec. 5, the Billings Gazette reports. Jody, 30, and Jase, 29, were already parents to son Jax, 6. \"With them being identical, they all shared the same placenta so there could be possible complications,\" Jody explains; Damron kept a close watch to make sure all the babies were growing equally. Jody stopped working in September and was admitted to the clinic with early signs of labor in November, but ultimately the babies waited until 32 weeks—about the average gestational age for triplets, according to Damron. They were born via C-section between 3 pounds, 11 ounces and 4 pounds, 1 ounce, and all were \"in excellent condition,\" he adds. Cade has been released from the hospital, but doctors want Milo and Ian to get a little better at eating first.

The Kansas City Star reports Missouri has been ordered to go smoke-free by April 1 because of the lawsuit Ecclesiastical Denzel Washington filed. Missouri already bans smoking inside prison buildings, but it allowed it in designated areas outside. The evidence at trial showed that inmates are commonly written up for smoking in their cells. Attorney Phillip Zeeck, who helped represent Washington, says the ruling may save Missouri taxpayers money because of the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses for the state's more than 30,000 inmates. Washington, 53, sued the state because he said he kept getting paired in a cell with a heavy smoker despite doctor's orders that he be held in a smoke-free area. The case has been working its way through the federal courts for a decade. Washington, who used to be known as Willie Simmons, was sentenced to death in 1989 for the murders of two St. Louis women. His sentence was later reduced to life in prison. \"This is a win ultimately for the people who work and live in Missouri's correctional facilities,\" Zeeck notes.

Attorneys for the convicted gunman, Daniel Green, say the original trial was rife with problems that only now are coming to light, the Charlotte Observer reports. To recap, Green and Larry Demery were teenagers when they were tried for murdering 56-year-old James Jordan—whose son was an all-time great NBA player—during a 1993 carjacking in South Carolina. In the high-profile trial, Demery became a witness for the state and accused Green of pulling the trigger. With physical evidence apparently supporting Demery, both were found guilty and eligible for parole in 20 years, but Green got an added 10 years for conspiracy. Now Demery is up for parole consideration, and Green's attorneys are claiming that: The trial's jury forewoman broke the rules by conducting her own investigation of the murder. Other jurors may have violated orders by reading or seeing accounts of the case. A state forensics expert admits that her testimony about blood in the car (which supported Demery's version of events) was shaky, and she destroyed the only existing blood sample from James Jordan on a supervisor's orders. The editor of a local Native American newspaper said that during a jail interview, Demery admitted to pulling the trigger. The first person the killers called from James' car phone was a cocaine dealer who happened to be Robeson County Sheriff Hubert Stone's out-of-wedlock son, but the jury wasn't allowed to hear about the sheriff's connection. Details about that could undermine \"the entire Jordan investigation,\" the attorneys say. A judge is likely to rule on the attorneys' request sometime after the end of April, says Bleacher Report."

According to Smithsonian, Hemingway scholars have long blamed the writer's decade-long decline and eventual suicide on some combination of alcoholism and bipolar disorder. But a psychiatrist in North Carolina says the actual culprit is something more associated with modern football players than authors: CTE. Andrew Farah has been studying Hemingway for 20 years, Fox 8 reports. By reading Hemingway's letters, memoirs by his friends and family, and the FBI file on him, Farah was able to trace what he believes is the source of Hemingway's downfall: at least nine concussions. Those concussions came from boxing, car crashes, exploding shells during two world wars, and more. \"His injuries and head traumas were frequent, random, and damaging,\" Farah writes in his newly published book, Hemingway's Brain. For example, following a plane crash that had likely already concussed him, Hemingway used his head to bash out a door and escape the plane. While we likely will never know for sure if Hemingway suffered from CTE, Farah says he showed symptoms in his final years, such as paranoia, anger, and violence. He also got worse following electroconvulsive therapy. \"It didn't take long to connect the dots,\" Farah tells Smithsonian. He says he hopes his conclusion will allow the focus to shift from the \"mythology\" of Hemingway's death to the greatness of his work. (How sports destroyed a young man's brain.)"

The diamond cross—believed to be worth more than $32,000—was stolen as part of an $11 million heist of Kim K's valuables last Monday at a luxury hotel in Paris. Authorities have reportedly found \"several\" DNA profiles on the piece of jewelry, which was found the following day near the scene of the crime. According to NBC News, investigators hope to use DNA from the pendant to find the men responsible for the robbery. Sources have described the crime, during which Kardashian West was tied up and feared rape, as six minutes of terror."

In theory, the vandalism carries a punishment of up to six months in prison and a $500 fine, but monument officials say they would be lenient if a young person comes forward. \"What better way to impress your date than to show that you're the type of person who will take responsibility for their actions?\" says monument rep Frank Hayde, per CNN.

That amount translates to about 105 bottles of wine per resident per year, the Independent notes. And no, this doesn't hinge around all that communion wine. As local media have pointed out, the number is probably so high because Vatican residents are, in general, older, male, and highly educated, and they eat communal meals. All of those factors tend to increase wine consumption. And with a population of just 800, those numbers are easily skewed by outliers. Oh yeah, and then there's the fact that just one store sells wine in the Vatican—and the wine is practically tax-free."

Cruz, of course, is the Republican incumbent hoping to keep his Senate seat, while O'Rourke is a 45-year-old three-term congressman mounting a surprisingly strong challenge. A new poll by Emerson College out this week has the race in a statistical dead heat, reports the Hill, which notes that Texas has not elected a Democrat to the Senate in three decades. Here's a look at the latest, including O'Rourke's growing national profile: Rock star: The Texas GOP tweeted an old photo of O'Rourke this week showing him back in the '90s with his old punk band, Foss. The photo was meant to mock O'Rourke, and some Republicans think it did just that. \"Wearing a dress?\" tweeted one strategist. But an analysis at the Washington Post thinks the photo actually endeared O'Rourke to far more people than it alienated. His \"rock-star status is cemented by Texas GOP, handing Dems an icon they desperately need,\" reads the headline. Oh, he skateboards, too."

In Paddington 2, he gets a job so he can buy a rare book for his aunt but is wrongly imprisoned for its theft before the transaction can take place. According to critics—who give it a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes—this is not a film to miss. \"The movie is full of bright wit and sincere joy, as Paddington's innate kindness permeates all around him, providing a weary world just what it needs right now,\" writes Sean P. Means at the Salt Lake Tribune. But much more than \"a warm bear hug,\" the film delivers fun \"by the bucketful\" and leaves no stone unturned \"if there's a clever joke to be found under it.\" In other words, it's \"completely delightful.\" \"What a pleasant surprise,\" Bruce DeMara writes at the Toronto Star. Blending \"seamlessly\" with its predecessor, Paddington 2 is \"family-friendly fun for all ages, thanks to a marvelous script, a sterling cast and the adept, sure-handed direction of Paul King,\" DeMara writes. He was especially impressed with \"a sublime pop-up animation scene that demonstrates King's copious attention to detail,\" but says the whole film is \"visually lovely.\" \"We'll be hard-pressed to find a more delightful film in all of 2018,\" Adam Graham puts it at the Detroit News. \"The whole enterprise is so whimsical and, well, British, that it feels like being whisked away to a different place,\" he writes. \"If you have kids, take them. If you have nieces and nephews, take them. If you don’t have kids but just want to feel like one yourself, go see it,\" he adds. \"Two paws up.\" Justin Chang, too, notes this is not just a film for kids. It keeps the \"gently whimsical, thoroughly British spirit of Michael Bond's original books\" and \"wraps you in its own warm embrace from start to finish,\" but is also \"full of inspired blink-and-you-miss-it wordplay,\" he writes at the Los Angeles Times, also applauding Hugh Grant's \"terrifically self-skewering\" performance and the \"marvelously intricate\" production design."

The Hill reports three Republican legislators in South Carolina introduced a bill Thursday that would let the state debate secession specifically \"if the federal government confiscates legally purchased firearms.\" It is extremely unlikely the bill passes out of the House by the April 10 deadline, according to the AP. Rep. Mike Pitts says the bill is meant to draw attention to gun rights. “I see a lot of stuff where people even talk about totally repealing the Second Amendment, which separates us from the entire rest of the world,” he says. In 1860, South Carolina became the first state to secede ahead of the Civil War."

Her Oscar, meanwhile, was for best supporting actress. She went on to have a long career in film, TV, and on Broadway—see this list for highlights.

How it summed the potential for catastrophe: \"At 20 feet, a pole vault accident is like someone falling off the roof of their house, while running as fast at they can with a thick pole in their hands.\" Such catastrophe struck on Thursday: During a practice jump that her manager described as routine, Austria's champion female pole vaulter landed just off the mat on her head and neck. The accident, which the Sydney Morning Herald reports was witnessed by her parents, left Kira Grunberg a paraplegic. The Austrian athletics federation said in a joint statement with the University Clinic in Innsbruck on Friday that the 21-year-old suffered \"a fracture of the cervical vertebrae of the spine\" and underwent \"emergency surgery to stabilize her spine.\" The statement puts it plainly: \"At the moment, the continuation of her sporting career is not an option.\" In a post to her Facebook page, Grunberg's family notes the \"tragic accident\" didn't just end her career but also means a \"new life\" and \"long and difficult\" path for her. NPR reports she is now breathing on her own, and describes Europe's sporting world as in shock but rallying to support Grunberg financially. Deutsche Welle reports Grunberg holds Austria's women's record of 4.45 meters, which she set during the European Championships in Zurich in 2014.

It's probably not a big surprise to find out that LOL is no longer the phrase of choice, but it might be surprising at just how far the old standby has fallen. In a week's worth of posts in May, just 1.9% of people who expressed laughter did so via LOL. Meanwhile, the undisputed the champion is \"haha\" (including variations such as \"hahaha\") at 51.4%, followed by the use of emoji at 33.7%, and \"hehe\" at 13.3%. Some other takeaways: 15% of people indicated laughter in at least one post or comment Residents of Chicago and New York prefer emoji, while those in San Francisco and Seattle like \"haha\" More men use \"haha\" and \"hehe,\" while more women use emoji So what's going on? It's not too complicated. \"Only old people are using LOL these days, presumably because it was popular in the internet’s early days but is now falling out fashion as emoji becomes the universal language of youths,\" observes Adam Clark Estes at Gizmodo.

CDC officials tell the Washington Post that 35 patients in the US have been stricken with Candida auris, a fungus that can cause bloodstream, wound, and ear infections, with another 18 people harboring the microbe without becoming ill. Some strains of the pathogen don't respond to the three main classes of antifungal drugs, and based on the small number of cases health officials have had the chance to review, 60% of patients hit with C. auris have died (though the agency notes many of those patients had other serious medical issues they were contending with). The fungus is contagious and durable, especially in health care facilities, where it can stick around on furniture and other equipment for months. The first C. auris strain was reported in 2009 in a Japanese man, and it has since spread around the globe, including to Colombia, India, Israel, Kenya, Kuwait, Pakistan, South Korea, Venezuela, and the UK. The first US case was reported in 2013, and the CDC's latest report places 28 of the incidents in New York state, with other affected states including New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Illinois. CDC Acting Director Anne Schuchat said at a recent briefing that \"scary,\" \"difficult to combat\" drug-resistant microorganisms are on the rise, per the Post. Some good news is that C. auris hasn't morphed yet into new strains, and most people's chances of contracting it are very low, with it only affecting \"the sickest of the sick,\" says CDC infectious disease specialist Tom Chiller. Also encouraging: a recent study IDing an antifungal that may prove useful. (No drug could save this Nevada woman.)"

Timberlake posted the photo to Instagram with the caption: \"Choose to have a voice! If you don't, then we can't HEAR YOU! Get out and VOTE!\" Now he could face 30 days in jail and/or a $50 fine. The local district attorney's office says the incident is \"under review.\" The Tennessee legislature passed the law banning the taking of photos and videos in polling stations in 2015, the Commercial Appeal reports. Timberlake would be the first person prosecuted under the new law. In addition to voting and possibly breaking a law, Timberlake posed for photos outside the polling station at the New Bethel Missionary Baptist Church. Local school board candidate Suzanne Jones posted hers to Twitter. \"I said, 'I know you’ve done it a lot, but I’d appreciate a picture with you,'\" Jones tells the Commercial Appeal. \"Someone was going to take it for me. But he said, 'No, I can take it. I do have gorilla arms, since I do this a lot.'\" Timberlake lives in Los Angeles and owns property in Nashville but is still registered to vote in Memphis.

As the Los Angeles Times reports, the pair filed a class-action lawsuit last night alleging that Sony \"failed to secure its computer systems, servers and databases, despite weaknesses that it has known about for years\" and \"subsequently failed to timely protect confidential information of its current and former employees from law-breaking hackers.\" The fallout from the hack is likely to cost Sony millions in legal fees and rebuilding its network, to the point where one executive is quoted yesterday as saying, \"This won't take us down. You should not be worried about the future of this studio.\" Of particular issue could be the employees' medical records, which are believed to have been breached. California law places on employers what the Times calls \"a strict legal obligation\" to protect such records.

Just a day after the attack, the CIA's reports were already referencing al-Qaeda in the Islamic Mahgreb. The following day, David Petraeus appeared before House and Senate groups; he, too, mentioned the terrorists, and was asked to compile unclassified talking points that Congress could use. By noon on Sept. 14, a draft was circulating—and it referenced al-Qaeda. But an exhausting process of editing followed, with more than two dozen CIA officials weighing in on the copy over email—and battling about the inclusion of al-Qaeda. Those opposed argued it should be removed because the intel was shaky (sourced from intercepted phone calls) and over fears it could alert al-Qaeda members to the fact that they were being watched. The opponents won out, though the term \"extremists\" remained; the FBI agreed with the call. It also contained this line: \"The demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the US Embassy in Cairo.\" On Sept. 15, the CIA station chief in Tripoli began to voice his concern with the assertions that the attack was both spontaneous and that demonstrations were occurring. He sent the CIA an email summarizing his thoughts the next day—but Susan Rice had already been hand-delivered the 94 fateful words the night before, so that she could prep for her news show appearances. Click for the Journal's full take, which charts the ultimate change in the CIA's assessment."

USA Today reports the five-time NBA championship winner was first stopped by cops in Newport Beach around 11pm for vehicle code violations before officers began a DUI investigation. According to reports, Rodman was given a breathalyzer test before being arrested and booked into Newport Beach Jail. The legal limit in California is .08, but police did not release Rodman's test results. TMZ reports the 56-year-old was cooperative and that he remained in custody for seven hours before officials determined he'd sobered up enough to go home. Rodman was previously arrested on DUI charges in 1999 and 2003. \"Alcoholism has been a struggle on and off for Dennis the past 15 years,\" a rep for Rodman told TMZ on Sunday. Rodman retired in 2000 after 14 seasons in the NBA. More recently, he's made headlines for his unlikely bond with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Just last month, the LA Times reported that Rodman wanted to arrange a diplomatic basketball game between North Korea and Guam, a US territory. “The people in Guam are all about it. They love it,\" he said while on what he called a \"humanitarian\" tour of Asia aimed at bridging the rift in US-DPRK relations. With President Trump and Kim Jong Un trading fiery rhetoric, Rodman used the occasion of his fifth and most recent North Korea visit to present a state official with a copy of Trump's The Art of the Deal in June."

Romney announced the move on Neil Cavuto's show on Fox, saying he couldn't cram it in on top of two other debates in December and a heavy campaign schedule, notes Mediaite. \"I spoke with Donald Trump earlier today and indicated that we just can’t make this debate,\" he said. \"We're going to focus on the other two we’ve got and on some campaigning.\" Romney said Trump understood and \"wished me well.\" So far, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum have accepted the invitation."

Reports don't specify the condition of the fries, or whether she even received them, but do make clear that an argument followed. Employees allege Dixson reached through the drive-thru window and, after an employee threw a soft drink at her, proceeded to spray them with Mace. The restaurant manager was hit directly in the face while two more employees were also in the line of the spray, per the police report. All three employees provided similar accounts of the incident, according to ABC News 5. Dixson is being charged with felony use of tear gas to immobilize.

Before he was executed this week, Brewer ordered up a Texas-sized feast, according to the Austin American-Statesman: \"Two chicken fried steaks, a triple-meat bacon cheeseburger, a cheese omelet, large bowl of fried okra, 3 fajitas and a pound of barbeque with a half-loaf of white bread on the side.\" Plus a pint of ice cream for dessert. The problem: He barely touched it. When that tidbit surfaced, a state lawmaker complained: “Enough is enough. It is extremely inappropriate to give a person sentenced to death such a privilege … one which the perpetrator did not provide to their victim.” State prison officials quickly announced the end of the program: Those about to die will get what all the other prisoners are getting. Daily Intel has more on the fascination about last meals."

KTSP notes that five of the victims suffered non-life-threatening wounds, while the sixth is now in stable condition, per KARE 11. The first shooting took place right outside the city's downtown police precinct around 1am local time, police spokesman Corey Schmidt tells CNN. After cops ran outside and found the first two male victims, as well as a gun, in a nearby parking lot, they heard more gunshots about 15 minutes later coming from a nearby block. That crime scene had three male victims and a juvenile victim. A man linked to the second shooting has been taken into custody, but Schmidt adds all six of the victims are being \"uncooperative\" as police try to find out if the two shootings are related. (An \"extreme case of road rage\" took place in Minneapolis this past spring.)"

James Rynerson was in custody late last month at the Mesa County Jail on a $2,000 cash bond while awaiting prosecution on menacing, disorderly conduct, and trespass charges, reports the AP. Rynerson, 38, was released after Mesa County sheriff's deputies at the jail mistook him for another inmate, Marvin March, who was awaiting release. Rynerson's wife was surprised to find him in her garage shortly after. \"(Rynerson's wife) told Inmate Rynerson he needed to turn himself in after he informed her he had been released under another person's name,\" the court report said, per the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel. She \"convinced Inmate Rynerson to go back, and personally drove him back to the Mesa County Detention Facility.\" Mesa County Sheriff's Sgt. Henry Stoffel said Wednesday that jail employees broke procedure when they failed to check Rynerson's wristband and picture, and that an investigation is ongoing to determine whether jail policy needs to be updated. He credited Rynerson's wife for his return. \"We appreciate that she recognized his error and recommended that he turn himself in before it became something more significant,\" he said. Rynerson, meanwhile, faces new charges for his efforts, including escape, forgery, criminal impersonation, and theft."

Jones, founder of the website Infowars, has infuriated parents by calling the 2012 schoolhouse massacre a hoax.

But zoo officials warn that what happened was anything but funny. \"Any unauthorized interaction with an animal is unsafe for the animal and potentially unsafe for the patron,\" a zoo spokeswoman says, noting something like this also breaks down the animals' trust that zookeepers have worked so hard to instill. The BBC notes hippos are responsible for more human deaths in Africa than any other big animal. The suspect could be hit with a misdemeanor charge or other infraction—California law bars anyone from climbing into zoo enclosures—but the case is being investigated as a trespassing violation, not an animal cruelty one, as the animals didn't seem particularly fazed by the incident."

While some Sanders supporters had been hoping for a vice presidential nomination for him, Sanders himself wouldn't be interested in the position anyway, according to a source close to him.

The Foreign Ministry says Vice Premier Liu He will visit the US from Tuesday to Saturday for consultations with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. Ministry spokesman Lu Kang also said China appreciated tweets by Trump saying he would help ZTE Corp. get \"back into business\" because too many jobs in China are at stake after the US government cut off access to its American suppliers. Liu's trip to Washington follows a visit by Mnuchin and other US officials to Beijing earlier this month, where they conveyed a demand that China slash its trade surplus with the US by $200 billion by the end of 2020, the AP reports. An intensifying rivalry over advanced technology has also fueled demands by Washington that China give up policies that favor domestic companies. Beijing considers such programs as fundamental to its state-driven economic model and vital for its future growth. America's trade deficit with China amounted last year to $337 billion in goods and services."

Instead of slowing or stopping, the vehicle knocks him over. Paulo Remes says he was bruised and taken to hospital, the Arizona Daily Star reports. \"I'm doing all right, I'm just a little sore, really,\" he says.

And Indivisible Tohono, an organization that sheds light on border policies, is posting the video on Facebook and Twitter. \"This is an example of the fear O’odham have to face everyday because BP ravage our communities & are careless with our lives,\" the group says in a tweet. Tensions have risen since tribal leaders opposed letting President Trump build a border wall there, and the land became a transit hub for drug traffickers and illegal immigrants."

And the number of Americans who engaged in not a single one of those 104 activities in all of 2014 is more than one in four of us: That's 83 million people, or 28% of the US population over the age of 6, reports the Wall Street Journal. \"We feel confident, in a sad way, that this is the largest number we’ve ever seen,\" says PAC member and Sports and Fitness Industry Association exec Tom Cove, who adds it's the most dismal result he's seen in 24 years. The number of completely sedentary Americans increased by 18% since 2007. That's not to say we don't like the appearance of fitness, just the actuality of it: The Journal notes the rise of \"athleisure\" apparel; such footwear saw sales jump 8% in the year ending April 11, while performance shoes took an 18% dive. The PAC traces the decline to our schools, which help form our lifelong fitness habits and where kids are spending less time in gym class and recess. Another problem? The increasingly cutthroat nature of sports is forcing more casual athletes to the sidelines. Says Cove: \"There are way too many kids who leave sports at age 9, 10, 11, because they simply have to make a decision: Am I going to be a travel soccer kid and devote my life to this, or are there other things that I want to do?\" (An editorial argues that it's not lack of exercise causing an obesity epidemic, it's the food industry's unhealthy products.)"

To start it up again, he was ordered to send in a copy of his passport—then told to use the name Ahmed because that's what appears on his passport. \"They insist I call myself by the first name I have never used,\" he complained. \"What a bunch of morons.\" Real first names are required by Facebook policy, even if you've used your middle name your entire life. “Dear #Facebook,” he tweeted, “forcing me to change my FB name from Salman to Ahmed Rushdie is like forcing J. Edgar to become John Hoover.” After much writerly moaning and groaning by the author of Satanic Verses, the profile page was reinstated with the name Salman Rushdie. Facebook said the takedown was all a misunderstanding and apologized. \"Victory. Salman returns,\" crowed Ahmed."

She maced me but said yes later,\" Oswalt tweeted. Salenger went with an equally dorky joke, posting on Instagram: \"I don't wanna brag ... but check out the size of The Rock on my finger!,\" along with a photo of Dwayne Johnson digitally placed over her engagement ring. Flirting via social media isn't anything new for the couple, who went public with their relationship last month at the premiere of Baby Driver. Oswalt's public expressions of happiness follow his equally public explorations of grief in the wake of wife Michelle McNamara's death, the New York Daily News reports. Oswalt has written about grief (\"102 days at the mercy of grief and loss feels like 102 years and you have s--- to show for it\") and raising his 8-year-old daughter without McNamara (\"I'm moving forward—clumsily, stupidly, blindly\") and addressed the loss of his wife in his stand-up sets. McNamara died suddenly in her sleep in April 2016 due to a mix of prescription drugs and an unknown heart condition. A source tells People Oswalt and Salenger met through mutual friend Martha Plimpton and are \"very happy.\""

Taylor says he's glad his son—who changed his name from Kori Taylor—was arrested and the bloodshed is at an end.

They also returned to the spot in Crete and discovered a mini leg bone. \"Dwarfism is a well-known evolutionary response of large mammals to island environments,\" said lead researcher Victoria Herrige from London's Natural History Museum. \"Our findings show that on Crete, island dwarfism occurred to an extreme degree, producing the smallest mammoth known so far.\" Researchers believe the animals may have evolved from regular-sized mammoths as long as 3.5 million years ago."

The Corner Cafe's Monster Mega Breakfast comes across as slightly redundant: It contains eggs and omelets, fried potatoes (four portions) and hash browns, and both toast and fried bread. Plus bacon, sausages, mushrooms, chips, onion rings, black pudding, tomatoes, and beans. The meal costs about $22.50 and has a time limit attached: Those attempting to polish it off have an hour to do so if they want to win a place on the wall of champions, a breakfast coupon, and a key ring. They'll be helped (or hindered?) along the way with one of two drinks: their choice of a milkshake or energy drink, reports the Bristol Post. A manager of the Portishead cafe tells the Post that since being launched earlier this month, five people have ordered it and none have finished. Quirky side note: No one under 18 is allowed to order it. The cafe's Facebook page has photos of those who have made the attempt, along with a message to those who have accused it of being wasteful. Its post begins, \"We are just a little family run business who can't save the entire world from famine and starvation!\" Could the 8,000-calorie breakfast be the start of a trend? The Bear Grills cafe in Congleton, England, made a splash a few months ago with the launch of its own 8,000-calorie meal, the 7-pound \"Hibernator.\" Sweet tooths may prefer its version, which includes four waffles.

Cable robbers have been cutting lines and leaving the sparking ends hanging; today, firefighters had to be called out to address the problem.

That's according to a report late Friday in the Wall Street Journal. Citing people familiar with the matter whom it did not identify, the Journal says San Francisco-based Uber Technologies Inc. filed the paperwork earlier this week. That would indicate it could go public within the first three months of next year. Uber declined to comment on the Journal report. Uber's advisers have suggested the company could get a valuation of $120 billion; its latest valuation was $76 billion when it sold about a $500 million stake to Toyota in August. The filing would come on the heels of a similar move by Uber's smaller rival Lyft. The two initial public offerings could raise billions for the two companies to fuel their expansions, while giving investors their first chance to buy stakes in the ride-hailing phenomenon. (One report says 30% of Uber and Lyft drivers actually lose money driving.)"

        "text": "– If President Obama absolutely killed Al Green's \"Let's Stay Together,\" Mitt Romney has apparently responded by just plain murdering a patriotic standard. The Republican candidate was caught on camera last night at a Florida campaign rally warbling \"America the Beautiful,\" which the Washington Post notes he has often called his favorite patriotic hymn. The unguarded moment on the eve of the primary is a departure for Romney, but the clip prompts Pier Morgan over at CNN to joke, \"I think this could be an actual issue.\""

        "text": "– One of the most widely circulated images to come out of the Texas flooding on Sunday showed several elderly residents of a nursing home sitting in waist-deep water. \"Need help asap emergency services please RETWEET,\" tweeted Timothy McIntosh. That's exactly what people did, and Galveston County Daily News reports that 15 elderly residents and three others from the La Vita Bella nursing home in Dickinson were rescued from the facility within hours. \"We were air-lifting grandmothers and grandfathers,\" says the chief of emergency management in Dickinson. The New York Daily News provides background on the tweet. McIntosh lives in Tampa, Florida, but his mother-in-law in Texas, Trudy Lampson, owns the nursing home and sent the image to him and his wife. He quickly put it online. \"Thanks to all the true believers that re-tweeted and got the news organizations involved,\" McIntosh wrote in a follow-up tweet after the rescue. \"It pushed La Vita Bella to #1 on the priority list.\" The myth-busting site Snopes looked into the veracity of the image and reports nothing fishy about it."

        "text": "– House Intelligence Committee Republicans have released their final findings on Russian interference in the 2016 US election, ending a yearlong probe, per the Washington Post. The heavily redacted 253-page report puts President Trump and his cohorts generally in the clear, noting the panel found \"no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded, coordinated, or conspired with the Russian government.\" What it did find was that the Obama administration dropped the ball with a \"slow and inconsistent\" response to the Russians, and that both the Trump and Clinton campaigns showed \"poor judgment and ill-considered actions.\" The report, which was said to be based on interviews with nearly 75 witnesses and a scouring of hundreds of thousands of documents, also concludes that any attempts of Trump associates to try to forge a relationship with Russia were either unsanctioned by Trump or didn't pan out. But the New York Times notes that Democratic committee members, who didn't endorse the report, have said their GOP colleagues didn't probe as deeply as they should have and wrapped up investigative efforts early to help shield the president from any trouble. A nearly 100-page Democratic rebuttal to the GOP's report says \"a majority\" of its findings are “misleading and unsupported by the facts and the investigative record,\" per the Post. Trump immediately jumped on the announcement, tweeting just minutes after the news broke: \"Just Out: House Intelligence Committee Report released. 'No evidence' that the Trump Campaign 'colluded, coordinated or conspired with Russia.' Clinton Campaign paid for Opposition Research obtained from Russia- Wow! A total Witch Hunt! MUST END NOW!\""

And now the Internet is going insane over a hidden panda, BuzzFeed reports. Illustrator Gergely Dudás, pen name Dudolf, shared an image on Facebook last Wednesday showing what appears to be a bunch of snowmen, along with the caption: \"There's a panda amongst them! Can you find it?\" Though some may spot the panda easily, many apparently have had trouble, with the more than 27,000 comments including ones like, \"There is no panda but it was nice\" and \"Been looking for 15 mins still can't find it lol.\" The image has been shared nearly 153,000 times so far."
