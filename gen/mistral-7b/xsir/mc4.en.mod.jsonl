First – decagon (aka: decagono, or just as the factory named it, deacon) was designed by Fenton Art Glass Company in response to popular demand; decagons replaced octagons – which sold very well – because they seemed “more modern” – with its faceted corners and curved lines – they created great refraction of their colors – and the modern world loved them!

{"prompt": "Laptop Pillow Desk | All Contemporary Design\nModern Laptop Pillow ", "response": "2021 – Modern laptop pillows serve many purposes, from making you more comfortable when working at your desk to serving as fashion accessories. When you work sitting upright, particularly if working for long periods of time, it is better for your posture if your shoulders are allowed to relax. A tablet or laptop is more ergonomic when it is able to sit at eye level than when it is on your work station. It can be easy to adjust the angle of laptops by simply tilting them back but this is not always comfortable and may make it easier for you to hunch over your laptop causing your shoulders and back to become strained. If your home office is already cramped for extra equipment then why not simply find somewhere for your laptop to rest without it taking up much extra space? For these reasons, modern laptop pillows and tablet stands will fit most needs. However, there is still some confusion between tablet pillows and their more traditional stand alternatives, so let’s take a closer look"}

Box 1 includes those sums, but they will likely never equal the total amount of your taxable income because of employer-paid benefits, retirement contributions, special payments to employers and more.

On one level, this allows developers to continue with the proven, familiar, thread-based process of software development by taking advantage of extra cores to help spread the load of computational tasks across multiple threads of execution to make their application run faster or do more real work. At a deeper level however, modern CMO architectures now often feature highly interconnected cores that can operate synchronously and in a fully SMP fashion which enables very different ways of implementing applications that, in turn, produce superior performance results.\n\n###"}

{"prompt": "Induction cooktops create heat from magnetic energy. This energy ", "response": " produces a “spiked magnetic field.” The cooking vessel heats up via induction as opposed to through thermal conduction via contact or flame via contact or conduction.\n\nThere are several advantages to the induction cooking as compared to other conventional appliances. Induction cookers turn warm more quickly, and can be turned on or off more swiftly than gas and electric ranges. The magnetic power is only emitted by the coil beneath the cookware, so nothing else in the vicinity is warmed, and only whatever pot or pan that is placed directly onto the glass gets warmed. Since it is more efficient than other alternative ranges, induction is very environmentally friendly, while producing an extremely clean and very sanitary workspace. Finally, since there will be no open flames, induction cooktops are very safe, since there is very little risk of fire compared to gas or electric ranges, and there is absolutely no danger of boiling liquids over.\n\nSome of the disadv"}

COD2 Big Red ONE is a game designed to bring the realism missing from COD2.\n\nThe game focuses mainly on American soldiers during WWII. You play as Sergeant Roebuck from Louisiana and get through most of the missions through his point of view. Some extra characters are introduced like Gunnery Sergeant Rasner, Sergeant Foley and Corporal Mendoza. These aren't played as main characters, but they add some variation to gameplay.\n\n## Setting Edit\n\nBig Red One introduces 6 Campaigns, and also unlocks different game modes and maps. The campaigns have been created by various people, and are not all storyline related. Most of the campaigns focus on different times and environments. Some of these campaigns require some download of Extra Content (EC) to play most of the campaigns.\n"}
