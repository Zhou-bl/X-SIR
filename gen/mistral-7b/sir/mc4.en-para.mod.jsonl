He stresses that Jesus' resurrection is not just for the sake of providing hope, but rather to demonstrate that Jesus is alive, not just an idea or a future hope.

{"prompt": "Wanted to short...\nWanted to short this so badly at", "response": "The chart indicates that the price may drop to $90 before rebounding. If it reaches $90, there is a possibility of a re-test of $97 as a support level.

I would consider buying the asset if it bounces from $90, with a stop just below that level. Otherwise, I would stay out of the trade for now but monitor it closely. Key points to watch are buying at $90.50, setting stops at $89, going long at $90, and closing the position if it breaks $89 or reaches $103. If the price falls to $75, it's advisable to cut losses. The worst-case risk is $1, with a lower breakeven at $93 and a lower cut loss at $89."}

{"prompt": "Study says horses 'talk' to other horses with ears,", "response": "A recent study suggests that horses may communicate their feelings through subtle movements of their noses. When a horse encounters a new or nervous horse in their herd, they may twitch their muzzles while facing towards it. This behavior appears to be noticed by other nearby horses, who then turn their heads and twitch their noses as well. Researchers believe that this could be a form of communication among horses, similar to how humans talk. However, there is still much to learn about the body language of horses, and experts like Elizabeth Strand of Texas A&M University will be exploring this topic further at an upcoming conference in Bloomfield Hills."}

Confirmation, on the other hand, is typically for adults who have already been baptized.

{"prompt": "Rainbow Moonstone Drop Earrings With Sterling Silver | Etsy\n5 ", "response": "Rainbow Moonstone is known for its unique interior sheen, called adularesence, which is a phenomenon exclusive to Moonstone and certain other materials. When one side of the stone catches the light, it appears creamy white and then transforms into a milky-blue hue as it contrasts with its darker side. This color change occurs in every facet of the stone, creating a shimmering effect that seems like a window into another world. Unlike most other luminescent minerals, Rainbow Moonstone's sheen is a result of its atomic composition being completely different from any crystals of its chemical group. The play-of-color effect has been studied and appreciated throughout history, and various theories have emerged to explain it. This phenomenon is caused by intergrowths of several layers of feldspar crystals, with the dark layers containing differing amounts of Fe content that act as a diffraction grating when exposed to white light."}

The initial stop should be used to lock in your profit, and you should also use another stop to exit the trade or take profits when the price reaches your initial stop. If you only have a take-profit level and not an actual stop, you could be left holding a position without the ability to cash out, so it's important to also use an exit stop. It's essential to think in terms of stop-loss and take-profit, and both levels should be used to close the trade. Let the trade ride as long as it moves in the right direction, but once the trend starts to change, take profits and exit any unprofitable trade. There's no definitive answer to how far your stop level should be from your entry price, but generally, market participants prefer to take profit before the trend reverses."}

{"prompt": "Despite the hotel's most flourish style, most travellers value", "response": "Our guests value their privacy and seek a comfortable, safe, and cozy environment in their rooms. Once checked in, they often prefer to be left alone. The most common guest interaction on HRS’s guest satisfaction portal, myHotelReservation, pertains to incidents of staff knocking on doors. While this may seem trivial, it is crucial for maintaining long-term guest relationships.\n\nLet's begin by examining guest ratings. Interestingly, staff are both highly praised and heavily criticized. Negative ratings often stem from staff knocking at inappropriate times and disturbing guests who are resting. Some guests also express frustration with staff entering rooms to replenish supplies without prior notice. These issues can be easily addressed, as they significantly increase the likelihood of complaints and damage claims. The solution is simple: a polite knock before entering, allowing guests adequate time to respond."}

In addition, there are other articles available that provide further insights.\n\nIn the first season, the focus was on the aftermath of the Battle of New York. However, the current season has introduced new elements, such as exploring the relationship between Fitzsimmons and the return of Hunter. The show has also changed its approach to handling plot points, opting for a different perspective on the characters' relationship rather than revisiting their initial meeting. This shift has brought out the youthful and naive nature of Fitzsimmons, leading to some awkward yet captivating situations. As a fan of their story, I found this change in dynamic to be particularly engaging."}

{"prompt": "The most common method of configuring two factor authentication is", "response": "Utilizing Google Authenticator or Authy is a common method for two-factor authentication (2FA). However, there is another popular but perhaps less known approach to 2FA using RADIUS servers. For enterprise networks where users have the same login credentials for applications and domain infrastructure, RADIUS Two Factor Authentication (or RADI0 authentication) can be implemented to provide an extra layer of security. This approach does not require a company to have its own server or dedicated infrastructure, as it can make use of the popular RADIUS authentication feature. If you are already familiar with using the RADI0 authentication approach, you may find increased control through PBX authentication systems, which allow for the creation of user accounts, roles, and policies."}
