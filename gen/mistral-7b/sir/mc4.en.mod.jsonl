{"prompt": "Black Agate Bracelet with Tiger Eye and Golden Charms - ", "response": "7mm Beads. Made by myself in California from authentic materials.\n\nThe Agate is a very attractive and popular polished gemstone. Agate is said to be a soothing and calming stone. Found in ancient burial sites of Egypt and Greece, Agate was believed to promote healing, courage and protection. The patterned bands of Agate resemble the layers of Earth. Its motif of strength is represented as concentric layers of a spherical rock in bands of color. To interpret this symbolic representation we see strength as being built up over time from an original inner nucleus. Strong rocks come out of weaker ones by building new layers. Agate also seems to give protection to it's owners. As is the symbolic pattern of Agate it stands strong on its own center rock.

The EPA says over 90 million pounds of pesticides were sprayed in open fields just in the US alone alone in 2009! Now some manufacturers make sure the bees never came in direct contact. Yet, some people believe pesticides have come off of their cars and tires after long road trips or trucking. Some get in contact with bees and some even get inside their comb. So what does this mean? Pesticides have long-lasting effects on honey bees it’s been said. There will be less bees. This means some other plants and"}
{"prompt": "Heart Attack Meat Consumption: Constitutional Freedom or Bankrupt Morality? ", "response": "04/02/17 By William F. Jasper- The New American Heart disease -- which is the number one killer of Americans -- has been largely blamed on cholesterol-clogged arteries, which is what really causes heart attacks. To prevent heart disease, for decades health officials have recommended restricting intake of eggs, beef, bacon, sausage, cheese, butter, cream, lobster, oysters, and other high-saturated-fat foods -- all of which contain the dreaded cholesterols. But a new study published in the medical journal Lancet found that total cholesteral, high-density lipoprotein, or HDL, or low-density liproprotein, or LDL, have very little to do with heart disease. Instead, they found, the greatest cause for heart disease is inflammation.  To fight inflammation, the new study suggests, cut down on red meat"}

The fact is Jacksonville needs a new QB and if they look around- in this case they just need to look around- they can make an deal with the San Francisco IQ.

There is no more clear explanation we find in God’s word. Jesus is alive, and like Lazarus, Jesus’ resurrection is proof enough for those who want proof. But if we need just one thing out of this word, God did not raise Jesus in order for us to have another hope. Jesus is not an idea, not some future hope, he is alive. He lives. The implications should be great enough even if you do not believe—Jesus is alive. The question before each individual is, what will you do with this living God.

The young adults – who have just spent the last two years studying the Bible in order to be confirmed – could truly appreciate an elegant confirmation party. Many people confuse confirmation ceremony gifts and favors with a similar ceremony called Christening. But the two are very different. Christening is for an infant receiving the baptism into God’s family. Confirmation is mainly given to adults who have previously been baptized. Some denominations don’t practice confirmation. Instead they go to the worship service together, take a class called the “new members class.” In the class everyone is introduced to other new members, new membership procedures, the role of the Pastor, the officers of the Church and the activities. The class is then made up of individual classes on Christian living. After graduating from the class you are given the “"}

You were raised Catholic and probably had some belief in God. Now I’m sure you have your own idea of what god is. Most people from our background, our upbringing were taught that God is love. It is a basic tenet upon which the Catholic religious order is founded. I implore you to really think about things for a moment. Consider the fact that if your body is destroyed, that love will be destroyed unless you leave this world behind and spread it. The most famous quote from Jesus himself, whom I’m confident you referenced on your show is love your neighbor as you love yourself. The only problem is the fact there there is no guarantee you love others the way you love yourself unless there is some hope, like faith, love, forgiveness.
