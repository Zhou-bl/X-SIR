This might sound like abstract thinking, but think of an artist making a piece out of wood: he will likely build a tiny replica of an apple log because of its shape and size. Then there’s the matter of color. Most artists prefer a single shade for their final creation.

The New Pearl Harbor documented what many of us believe—that a nuclear holocaust could occur at any time because too little money and too few restrictions are invested with respect to our national security.\nHowever, a conventional U.S./NATO attack against Syria would be an even bigger setback — one which would force us all into a third world war sooner rather than later. There’s evidence suggesting it could happen within years as opposed to decades. It should also be noted that most leaders aren’t working toward peace but rather continually increase the risk through policies such as NATO expansion (through Poland & Romania), support for Israel’s apartheid system; along with endless wars"}

NASA says the red planet is very similar to our planetary system because it also had lava flows, lakes filled with brine all along its surface layers. Because of this similarity between Mars's soil/landscape vs Earth's soil, one questioned how these rover robots really can measure water content at a molecular level when compared to using an instrumentation method that looks for the presence or not ashes for evidence. Soil without ash can test a plant chemical in order for a chemist to better decipher the root-mediated growth factors involved. The presence of such moisture means the roots are able to extend deeper to find more nutrition. With so many interesting readings found by our rovers working on Mars today (i.e. sand size, composition, humidity), what questions do I want answered about Mars.

As a result there was a large demand for small arms (in this case Pistols), so as not to have the U.S Navy overrun by the Brits. However because the state laws didn’t want guns “hanging around” or “living dangerously” They also wanted things taken away!

{"prompt": "A scientists' march on Washington is a bad idea –", "response": " here’s why\nby The Conversation\nA march organized by the Union of Concerned Scientists calling for action against climate emergency has been called off. From ScienceNews: With organizers postponing the March for Climate this week citing a lack of support, some are wondering if the April 20 date makes sense—and what should be done instead.

And considering how slim and sleek this looks/feels on my hips and breast area as opposed to more of the traditionally bulky looking half heart shape ones i had grown used to wearing over a pair of boyshorts -- its surprisingly comfortable without sacrificing any modesty or freedom from moving around or having the fit pull at me throughout my exercise or leisure time activities as well. I love the look, feel and the fit. Highly recommend if your just getting started in finding a silicone breast enhancer piece that feels right for you. Very happy customer!\nPerfect Fit - The bra fits perfect - not too tight and holds everything in where it should be. Got so many compliments when out and about and am really pleased with this purchase :D Will keep mine on at all times."}
