When selecting a music box with AgileTM carbon tongues, it's important to consider both the breath efficiency and tone, as they can significantly impact each other. Breath efficiency is a crucial factor to consider, as different materials produce different sounds and resonances. While steel creates a rich, dark sound with minimal resonance, it is prone to rust and wear if not properly maintained. Many musicians opt for plastic or felt materials, as they offer great sound quality even after prolonged use and are more cost-effective.
