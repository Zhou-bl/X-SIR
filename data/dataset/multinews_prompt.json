We used Heritrix (3.1.1-SNAPSHOT) crawler software and respected robots.txt directives. The scope of the crawl was not limited except for a few manually excluded sites. \n \n However this was a somewhat experimental crawl for us, as we were using newly minted software to feed URLs to the crawlers, and we know there were some operational issues with it. For example, in many cases we may not have crawled all of the embedded and linked objects in a page since the URLs for these resources were added into queues that quickly grew bigger than the intended size of the crawl (and therefore we never got to them). We also included repeated crawls of some Argentinian government sites, so looking at results by country will be somewhat skewed. \n \n We have made many changes to how we do these wide crawls since this particular example, but we wanted to make the data available “warts and all” for people to experiment with. We have also done some further analysis of the content. \n \n If you would like access to this set of crawl data, please contact us at info at archive dot org and let us know who you are and what you’re hoping to do with it.

Instead, she left after her first year to pursue a modeling career in Milan. \n \n As recently as a week ago, Ms. Trump’s website stated that she had obtained a degree before going on to become a philanthropist and skin care entrepreneur. \n \n On Wednesday, The Huffington Post noticed that the site had been entirely scrubbed of its content. People clicking on its address are now redirected to the Trump Organization’s website. \n \n In a Twitter post, Ms. Trump said the website had been removed “because it does not accurately reflect my current business and professional interests.” \n \n Last week, Ms. Trump’s speech at the Republican National Convention contained a few lines from Michelle Obama’s speech at the Democratic convention in 2008. The Trump campaign initially denied that she had plagiarized the lines. Eventually a Trump employee who had helped write the speech, Meredith McIver, acknowledged using Ms. Obama’s lines and apologized, saying it was unintentional.\nSummary:\n",

All in all, the authors hope to define peace as “the harmony achieved by the absence of violence or the fear of violence.” \n \n \n \n Once again, Iceland is the most peaceful country on earth, followed by Denmark and Austria. Meanwhile, conflict-ridden countries like Syria, South Sudan and Iraq and Afghanistan are at the bottom of the list. Syria landed at the bottom due, in part, to its civil war, which “broadened its international scope as a result of the Russian intervention that began in September 2015 on the side of the Syrian government,” the authors note. \n \n The United States ranks 100th (out of 163 total areas) in terms of peacefulness. This low score is thanks, in part, to these factors: “U.S. involvement in the armed conflict against ISIL escalated” and “relations between the U.S. and Russia have also deteriorated.” \n \n This study is far from the final word on peacefulness. The authors admit that “peace is notoriously difficult to define.” Plus, many of the things they use to measure peace are qualitative, and thus prone to human judgement, which can be skewed. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

But stressed mice with the gene developed depression-like symptoms which were then eased by using anti-depression drugs, they found. \n \n Depression, like many other mood disorders, is believe to have multiple causes, including genetic, for its symptoms vary widely among individuals. \n \n As many as 40 percent of depressed patients do not respond to drugs, which are mainly based on boosting uptake of a brain chemical called serotinin. \n \n Almost one in six Americans are afflicted by depression in any given year, and the disorder costs the US economy 100 billion dollars annually, according to figures quoted in the study. \n \n The finding \"identifies MKP-1 as a potential target for a novel class of therapeutic agents, particularly for treatment-resistant depression,\" Yale said in a press release. \n \n Copyright © 2010 AFP.

APPAC compared outcomes for open appendectomy with antibiotic therapy for acute uncomplicated appendicitis, finding that antibiotics were a reasonable alternative to appendectomy. The study failed to meet its prespecified noninferiority margin to demonstrate that antibiotic treatment resulted in clinical outcomes that were “no worse than” outcomes with surgery, the operations were open and not laparoscopic, expensive broad-spectrum antibiotics were used, and the hospital lengths of stay were too long in each group (median, 3 days in the antibiotic group and in the surgery group). Despite the study limitations, of the 257 patients in the antibiotic group, 186 (73%) initially treated with antibiotics did not require surgery at the 1-year end point. However, concerns were raised that these patients would eventually require surgery, and various experts recommended that the APPAC results for clinical decision making not be used until the long-term outcomes were known for the patients who received antibiotic treatment.

Three North Korea short-range... (Associated Press) \n \n SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea fired an unidentified projectile from its capital Pyongyang that flew over Japan, officials said, an especially aggressive test-flight that will rattle an already anxious region. \n \n Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff on Tuesday said the South Korean and U.S. militaries were analyzing the launch and didn't immediately confirm how far the projectile traveled. Japanese officials said the missile flew over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido and landed in the Pacific Ocean. There was no damage to ships or anything else reported. Japan's NHK TV said the missile separated into three parts. \n \n The launch comes days after the North fired what was assessed as three short-range ballistic missiles into the sea and a month after its second flight test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, which analysts say could reach deep into the U.S. mainland when perfected. \n \n North Korea typically reacts with anger to U.S.-South Korean military drills, which are happening now, often staging weapons tests and releasing threats to Seoul and Washington in its state-controlled media. But animosity is higher than usual following threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to unleash \"fire and fury\" on the North, and Pyongyang's stated plan to consider firing some of its missiles toward Guam. \n \n Pyongyang regularly argues that the U.S.-South Korean military exercises are an invasion rehearsal.

The penny might be more trouble than it's worth. The cost to produce the one-cent coin increased to 1.5 cents during 2016, the Wall Street Journal reported. In 2015, the penny cost 1.43 cents to make, while in 2014, its production value was 1.66 cents. \n \n The president and Congress is constantly cutting funds to important programs to save money. Here’s a easy way to cut the budget plus get rid of a coin no one really likes or needs. Our bases overseas do not use pennies. The lowest denomination is the nickel. The only pennies you see overseas are those brought over by new recruits. ||||| Pennies aren’t cheap. \n \n The one-cent US coin, mostly made of zinc with a little bit of copper, is the most abundant coin in the country. Last year, the US Mint produced more than 8.4 billion pennies for circulation. Between production costs and shipping, they cost $0.0182 each, which totaled to $69 million (pdf, p. 9) in losses compared to their total value—the biggest in nine years. This is likely due to the rising cost of zinc for use in heavy industry, construction, machine and ship building, and steel production. \n \n Nickels have cost more to make than their monetary value for over a decade. The five-cent coins—75% copper and 25% nickel—cost about seven cents each to produce last year. Prices for copper have surgedIt’s a key ingredient in any kind of circuit or wiring, and the rise of electric cars in particular has put stress on the market. Nickel has also gotten more expensive for its use in stainless steels. \n \n Fortunately, dimes and quarters are cheaper to make, costing less than their monetary value. So the Mint makes up the losses incurred on pennies and nickels with its 10- and 25-cent coins, and last year reported making $391.5 million in seigniorage.\nSummary:\n",

In other words, that’s an additional 258 hours per year or an hour more each weekday. The working paper, which has not yet been published, was written by three economists—Alexander Bick of Arizona State University, Bettina Bruggeman of McMaster University in Ontario, and Nicola Fuchs-Schundeln of Goethe University Frankfurt. \n \n The authors looked at 18 European countries and the U.S. Of the 19 total countries they examined, the U.S. came out on top averaging 26.1 hours per person per week; Italy worked the fewest hours with an average of 18.4 hours. \n \n The study looked at hours per person. It doesn’t only include people currently in the workforce, but those either retired or taking time off for some other reason, like unemployment or vacation. Ultimately, it doesn’t measure productivity, but rather total time spent at work. \n \n The disparity in hours worked between the U.S. and Europe could be explained in various ways or, more likely, is an amalgamation of numerous different reasons. Taxes, for one, are much higher in Europe than in the U.S. According to Bloomberg, that gives European workers less incentive to work longer hours. It may also have something to do with labor unions, which generally have more power in Europe than they do in the U.S. \n \n Additionally, Europeans tend to get generous pensions, rather than investment plans like the 401(k) many American workers receive. As a result, there are more American workers over 65-years-old now than there have been at any point in the past 50 years.\nSummary:\n",

It is a carefully edited montage designed to highlight the giddiest and strangest moments of a roughly 25-minute speech. The owner of the YouTube account, CharlieJohnson1986, did not respond to a message sent to the account. \n \n But while the video is designed to make Perry look bad, it does capture elements of his speech that were widely remarked upon in the crowd by those who saw the speech. \n \n \"It was different,\" Manchester Mayor Ted Gatsas told HuffPost after the speech. \n \n A Perry spokesman did not respond to an e-mail Friday night inquiring about Perry's manner, and initially declined to comment on Saturday. \n \n Update at 9:25 p.m.: \n \n \"The Governor is passionate about the issues he talks about,\" Perry spokesman Mark Miner said in an email to HuffPost on Saturday night. \n \n This article has been changed to remove a reference unrelated to the event. It has also been updated to reflect that Rick Perry's spokesman declined to comment Saturday. Mark Miner later offered comment.\nSummary:\n",

The first paper summarises data for the prevalence and consequences of problem use of amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, and opioids. In high-income countries, illicit drug use contributes less to the burden of disease than tobacco, but a substantial proportion of that burden is due to alcohol. Intelligent policy responses to drug problems need better prevalence data for different types of illicit drug use and the harms that their use causes globally. This need is especially urgent in high-income countries with substantial rates of illicit drug use and in low-income and middle-income countries close to illicit drug production areas. The second paper reviews existing drug policies and highlights the need for greater reliance on scientific evidence-based policy making. The final paper examines the value of international drug conventions in protecting public health.\nSummary:\n",

Then it reversed itself, saying it would publish the 7,000-page report in its entirety.

Gelb, the director of the task force that wrote the report. “I couldn’t begin to guess where those words came from,’’ he said, before hazarding a guess that they might come from the sections on peace negotiations, which were left out of the first versions of the report that were leaked. \n \n It sounded like a job for Twitter, if not for its large community of indiscreet intelligence analysts, then because 140 characters seemed just about right for 11 words.

But federal officials had refused to transport her or temporarily release her so that others may take her for the procedure. \n \n Lawyers for the Department of Health and Human Services, which is responsible for sheltering children who illegally enter the country unaccompanied by a parent, said the department has a policy of \"refusing to facilitate\" abortions and that releasing the teenager would require arranging a transfer of custody and follow-up care. \n \n The teenager's lawyers said all the government needed to do was \"get out of the way.\" An attorney appointed to represent the teen's interests said she could transport her to and from appointments necessary for the procedure, and the federal government would not have to pay for it. ||||| Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Mr. Barrett purchased a salted soft pretzel from a cart in the park, ripping off tiny pieces and tossing them off the shore.

Minka Kelly's rep confirmed the news to PopSugar. The sexy couple who first got together around May of 2008 faced rumors ranging from splits to engagements over the years, though apparently they weren't able to make it work in the end. Derek is in the middle of his season with the NY Yankees while Minka is currently on location in Miami where she is shooting the Charlie's Angels reboot. Minka has her badass Charlie's Angels work to keep her distracted from any post-breakup blues and Derek crossed his own amazing milestone this Summer, becoming only the 28th MLB player to ever cross the 3000 hit mark. It's sad to hear that Minka and Derek are going their separate ways, though neither of the freshly single stars should have too much trouble finding new love if they want to.\nSummary:\n",

Animals, and people, sometimes walked across the drying tiles and left their footprints behind. The cat is thought to have snuck across the wet tiles in Gloucester in about AD100, probably at the annoyance of the tile makers, but this did not stop the Romans from using the tile. The tile, a type called tegula, was used on the roof of a building in what became the Berkeley Street area of modern Gloucester.” \n \n Cats: even the Romans couldn’t keep them in line. \n \n Contact the author at ellie@jezebel.com.\nSummary:\n",

I think John Hawkins is spot on in detecting the sarcasm here, but if you’re inclined to believe that Ayers is The One’s ghostwriter, you’re bound to detect a “deeper truth” in his tone. In fact, Ayers has been baiting people with this same corny line about splitting the royalties for ages. Back in October 2009, a conservative blogger spotted him in Reagan Airport and approached him. As soon as she mentioned that she was conservative, he offered, unprompted, that he had written the book, that Michelle Obama had put him up to it, and, yes, that he’d be happy to split the royalties with the blogger if she could prove it. When she countered that she thought he had at least edited it, he egged her on by insisting that no, he had written the darned thing. I think he enjoys mocking people who push this idea and enjoys it doubly when they can’t detect the mockery. In fact, I’d bet that this is his stock response anytime the book is mentioned in his presence — insisting that he wrote it to see if the listener laughs and then toying with them if they seem credulous. But as I say, your mileage may vary. \n \n Related Posts:\nSummary:\n",

(AP) — Missouri prisons have been ordered to eliminate smoking after an asthmatic inmate serving a life sentence for two murders won a court judgment. \n \n The Kansas City Star reports Missouri has been ordered to go smoke-free by April 1 because of the lawsuit Ecclesiastical Denzel Washington filed. \n \n Missouri already bans smoking inside prison buildings, but it allowed it in designated areas outside. The evidence at trial showed that inmates are commonly written up for smoking in their cells. \n \n State officials haven't announced details of their plan to eliminate smoking at 21 correctional facilities. \n \n Attorney Phillip Zeeck, who helped represent Washington, said the ruling may save Missouri taxpayers money because of the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses for the state's more than 30,000 inmates. \n \n \"This is a win ultimately for the people who work and live in Missouri's correctional facilities,\" said Phillip Zeeck, who is with the Polsinelli law firm \n \n Washington sued the state because he said he kept getting paired in a cell with a heavy smoker despite doctor's orders that he be held in a smoke-free area. The case has been working its way through the federal courts for a decade. \n \n The 53-year-old Washington, who used to be known as Willie Simmons, was sentenced to death in 1989 for the murders of two St. Louis women. His sentence was later reduced to life in prison. \n \n ___ \n \n Information from: The Kansas City Star, http://www.kcstar.com ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Green's accomplice, Larry Martin Demery, testified that he and Green walked up to James Jordan's car with the intention of robbing him. Demery told the jury Green shot Jordan after he awoke from a nap and saw the two men outside his car. \n \n However, Green's attorneys, Scott Holmes and Ian Mance, contend Demery pulled the trigger and that their client wasn't at the scene at the time of the murder. They've brought forth new evidence in order to get Green a new trial, according to court documents obtained by Gordon and Washburn. \n \n Holmes and Mance have a sworn statement from the jury forewoman in Green's trial that says she investigated Jordan's murder on her own, which would've gone against the judge's orders. A former newspaper editor from Robeson County, North Carolina, also signed a sworn affidavit in which she described an admission by Demery that he committed the murder. \n \n The attorneys also cast doubt on the evidence provided by a state forensics expert regarding Jordan's blood being found in Green's car. \n \n The state of North Carolina has until the end of April to respond to Holmes and Mance's filing, and after that, Robeson County Superior Court Judge Robert Floyd will make a decision about a new trial. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

He went to medical school, became a psychiatrist and now explains Ernest Hemingway to so many of his fans. \n \n For 20 years, Farah has used his training to study what a number of concussions that Hemingway suffered – at least nine, by Farah’s count – did to his brain. \n \n “You have this man who is a genius and, as he ages, the cumulative damage that his brain sustained led to a deterioration in the work - not only the life and interactions were affected but the work was affected,” says Farah. “And the two plane crashes in Africa really sealed the deal. Those were severe.” \n \n In one of them, Hemingway – probably already concussed from the crash – used his head to knock out the door he used to escape the plane that was filling with smoke. \n \n “Hemingway, himself, in multiple letters wrote about the effects of concussion,” says Farah. “And his exact words were, ‘I've been studying it and concussions are a funny thing.’” \n \n They weren’t funny by the end of his life. In fact, Farah believes they played a central role in why Hemingway killed himself in 1961, three weeks before his 62nd birthday, and tells the story in his new book \"Hemingway’s Brain.\" \n \n “There's so much mythology surrounding him that I wanted to set the record straight,” says Farah. \n \n See if you think he did in this edition of the Buckley Report. ||||| NYT bestselling author Wiley Cash’s new novel, ‘The Last Ballad,’ is his best\nSummary:\n",

He is insulting all officers in uniform. These are people who have got families, and he is using that vulgar language,\" police spokesman Wayne Minaar told The Star newspaper. \n \n Police are mulling charges of defamation and defeating the ends of justice, arguing that revealing the location of roadblocks could help criminals on the run evade arrest, he said. \n \n PigSpotter has refused to reveal his identity. He told The Star that as a goodwill gesture he would stop pointing out roadblocks, but would keep helping speeders.\nSummary:\n",

The American tax code is a \"known unknown\", in Rummiespeak. It is 70,000 pages long and might as well be written in Klingon. Few Americans have a clue whether they are complying with it. Some 90% of them (including Mr Rumsfeld) pay a tax accountant or use commercial software to help navigate it (see Economist articles here and here and here and here and here, among others).

In a weird and seemingly quite patronizing twist, a heavily-accented Korean immigrant woman in a laundromat awkwardly interrupts him throughout the ad, finally asking the camera “What’s a mensch?” The clip is drawing attention from viral video sites. \n \n It seems clear that Adler, who is backed by former Disney CEO Michael Eisner, is going the “Demon Sheep” route, using ads specifically designed to spread online out of shock value or just sheer weirdness. In another out-there spot, former child star Patty Duke declares “Dan Adler: He Gets Shit Done.” \n \n In a similarly foul-mouthed video, Adler ups the shock factor to 11 by having his own young son deliver the catchphrase.

It also says a current theory for the hole is that a local water line that broke near the Charleston plant could have made the ground beneath the storage tank freeze in the cold days before the spill. \n \n After the spill, residents in a nine-county area around the state capital of Charleston were told not to use the water for anything other than flushing toilets.

Their feat was all the more impressive for the fact that they conducted the interview through a translator, which at first seemed like it might become drag on the interview. \n \n Instead, the responses from Pussy Riot members Nadya Tolokonnikova and Masha Alyokhina were so sharp, funny, and at times poignant, that the presence of the translator only served to hang the viewer on every word. They talked about their imprisonment and release, took shots at Putin, daring him to put them back in jail, and provided alternately hilarious and sobering commentary on the state of Russia’s anti-gay laws. Sometimes, it seems, humor isn’t lost in translation, it is revealed. \n \n Here’s the video of Colbert’s interview with Pussy Riot, in two parts, from Comedy Central: \n \n \n \n \n \n Part Two: \n \n \n \n \n \n Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

In effect, the measure would sharply limit Mr. Trump’s ability to suspend or lift sanctions on Russia — handcuffing a sitting president just six months into his term with the nearly unanimous support of a Republican-led Congress. \n \n The Trump administration has opposed the sanctions against Russia, arguing that it needs flexibility to pursue a more collaborative diplomacy with a country that, by American intelligence consensus, interfered in last year’s presidential election.

He credited Rynerson's wife for returning her husband to custody. \n \n ___ \n \n Information from: The Daily Sentinel, http://www.gjsentinel.com ||||| Sorry, this zipcode is not in our deliverable area for this subscription service. \n \n Re-enter zip code or sign up for digital access. \n \n Get digital access\nSummary:\n",
