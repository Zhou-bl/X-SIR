{"prompt": "Why do old games running on new hardware still have technical issues?\nAn elaboration of the question: I am playing some mega man games on my Xbox One and experience slowdown when there are a lot of enemies on screen. but the Xbox One is significantly more powerful than the NES, so why is there still slowdown on this hardware?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The XBox is emulating NES hardware and running the emulation at a set speed. If it ran it at as fast as possible, then it would be several times faster than the original NES game and would be unplayable. I can't speak for Mega Man exactly, but older games tended to run on a cycle locked to the screen refresh which was a fixed 60Hz or 50Hz. There was only one piece of hardware they ran on, so there was no need to adjust for different hardware speeds.", "In that case, it's probably on purpose - they want to emulate the experience as closely as possible, even including the slowdown and sprite flickering. Some emulators let you turn it off, but it's usually turned on by default. In other cases, like if you're trying to emulate PS2 games on your PC, the game might just run really slow in general. Even though your PC is way more powerful than a PS2, it has to \"translate\" from PS2 language to PC language in realtime, which is much more difficult than running PS2 code on the PS2 itself."]}
{"prompt": "Why are electrical lines slack between poles?\nAn elaboration of the question: Is there a good reason or is it just that they're too heavy to be pulled taut?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Because if they were pulled taut, then a strong wind could bend the poles away from each other and snap the lines, loosing high energy power lines onto the ground below which can be extremely dangerous. A little bit of slack is just fine.", "There are a few reasons. First, they're metal. Metals expand and contract with heat--if there was no slack, they'd possibly break under extreme temperature changes. Second, birds and debris sometimes land on them. You need them to be able to take some weight, which means they can't be stretched too tight.", "The lines have mass. So there is something that needs to hold them up. Any force is composed of a horizontal and a vertical force. And a line under tension have a force following the line. So in order to keep the line up you need a certain force up on each pole in addition to the horizontal force. You could increase the horizontal force which would make the line more straight but it would still have some slack in them. You can not get rid of it. The amount of slack in a power line is a compromise between the force that can be applied to the lines before they or the poles snap in wind and how tight the lines have to be to not hit each other or the ground."]}
{"prompt": "Why is it so hard to completely prevent clipping of 3D models in video games?\nAn elaboration of the question: To be clear, I know nothing about programming or 3D graphics. Naively, I would think you could just give objects some property by which they cannot pass through each other. Yet I see some degree of clipping in almost every big studio 3D game. Why is this so hard to fix?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["It comes down to hitboxes. These are imaginary cubes drawn around \"things\" in games. The more detailed the hitboxes are, the more computations need to be done to determine if things collide. Lets say you have a minecraft dude. His hitboxes are simple because he's already a few cubes. Its easy to do the math to determine when one cube hits or intersects or runs into another cube. Or if I shoot your minecraft dude with a gun, all I have to do is aim within the imaginary hotbox cubes that surround your dude. Pretty simple. But as the 3d models of things (your Halo dude, that explody barrel, the monster) get more complex, the less ideal a few cube hitbox is going to be. no, you want the hitbox for your character to match the geometry of your character. If your Halo dude had a simple single hitbox cube, if you got a rocket anywhere in that imaginary cube it would count as a hit. But thats bullcrap because you totally jumped that rocket, it went _between_ your dude's legs. So now, to be more accurate the hitbox model that represents where your dude \"is\" has to be made up of a bunch of smaller geometric shapes. Maybe, the hitbox model of your dude is almost as complex as the visualization model of your dude. But as you add complexity to that model, all the math to calculate whether bullets, rockets, explody things collided or hit your dude, get a lot more complex. And complexity is fine, but there's only so much processing power available, given your game client and the server have to calculate not only whether your dude got hit by that grenade blast, but the other 63 dudes on the server. Its a similar thing to the calculations on how your dude is affected by the geometry of other things. Your guy is leaning up against a wall? If the collision/hitbox model of your guy was really detailed, and the geometry of your dude's model was programmed to do it, you could model individual limbs (nay, in some games with ragdoll physics, individual bones) and how they interact with a wall, a crate, riding that horse... but again, complexity and \"realism\" brings computations. So the guys who write game engines have to strike a balance between \"well maybe the wizard's flowing robes sometimes clip into the wall he's standing next to, but at least a 64 person battle has a decent frame rate\" vs. \"we have simulated character models down to individual chest hairs. But you can only get 2 frames per second.\"", "Vfx student here. From what I know, In order to do that would essentially require creating everything as physics objects or create individual hit boxes for each element in the game. Not easy and can really place a burden on your computer. I am sure there is someone more experienced in this topic, but depending on how detailed the models or elements in the game are, it's just easier to allow clipping in a few of the elements rather than miss a release date or spend money trying to correct the problem. Hope that helps."]}

He wanted to realize wireless power transfer - but that still would have required a power source to run the system. The reason nobody ever put money on his idea was not just the risk of people tapping into it, but also that it's wasteful. Wireless energy transfer over big distance is inevitably going to cause losses, whereas conventional systems with power lines (to which his work contributed a great deal) can achieve great efficiency over long distances. The entire concept of free energy is not pursued by power companies because it's simply not possible.

{"prompt": "Why are semis that carry liquid cylindrical, and not rectangular?\nAn elaboration of the question: I was riding my bike down the road and semi carrying gasoline went by, and I thought, \"why not make a rectangular container, shouldn't it hold more liquid?\". Knowing I don't know anything about that stuff, can someone explain to me why we don't use rectangular semis for liquid transport?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Curved structures are mechanically stronger at storing contents under pressure. The pressure is pushing evenly of all sides of a curved surface, so they are less likely to burst. If you have lines or corners there is uneven distribution of load on the interior of vessel. More info can be found here: URL_0", "* cylinders are stronger than rectangles...liquid loads tend to be heavier and can slosh, putting more strain on the trailer than solid loads * a filled tank of most liquids is already operating at near the maximum load limit, there is little advantage to providing extra space * the shape makes it easier to drain", "Also, most tankers have multiple baffles or compartments in them. The weight transfer from thousands of gallons of liquid sloshing around, can easily overcome braking force and. An also causing roll overs on turns", "Think of it in this way: Most materials are a lot stronger when you pull them and not bend them. Just think of a piece of paper. It can handle a lot of force when you pull it, but it will have literally no resistance for bending it. With metal it is exactly the same, only that metal itself is a lot stronger. When you weld metal together as a tube, it is a clever design, so when you put pressure inside the tube, the tube will try to expand. But to expand, its circumference would have to get bigger. And this means that the force caused by the pressure was converted into \"pulling-force\" circular around the circumference. With a rectangular container this wouldn't work. On the edges, the pressure will try to bend up the edges and usually the container will fail/rip open. But just imagine the rectangular container to be of a very bendable material, like rubber. Now apply pressure inside. As the pressure increases, the rectangular container will deform and end up circular. Because this is the most officiant form."]}
{"prompt": "Why do boy bikes typically have a bar across the top whereas girl bikes do not?\nAn elaboration of the question: And that carries over from kids' bikes to bikes for adults. Just seems to me that, if anything, given human anatomy it would be reversed.

Why is it still common? 2. Why do male bikes have that bar at all?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Women used to wear long dresses to used to have to have to \"step through\" the frame in order to preserve their modesty. Males on the other hand could just pop their leg over the top. The tradition has just been maintained on most commercial bikes.", "It's a carry-over from the days when girls and women only work dresses or skirts-and-blouse outfits. The bar on a \"men's\" bike would make riding one in a dress quite awkward.", "I thought this was a holdover from olden times, when girls' bikes had to accommodate for dresses.", "Because girls traditionally wear skirts and dresses which get pushed up by the bar on boys bikes. In Scotland boys bikes also have the low crossbar because of the tradition of wearing kilts.", "As for 2, it's because of physics. Both men and women's bikes have the bar, which is necessary to form a truss in the central bike structure which is far, far stronger than just a single pipe. The only difference is the women's bar connects much lower than the men's, which structurally makes it weaker. This is due to a combination of men being physically heavier and that stereotypically men do more mountain biking/crazy outdoor stunts which would require the stronger frame. Where or not that's really true, men's bikes are actually the better design from a strength standpoint, and the altered frame on women's bikes is a concession due to the whole skirt thing and it's stuck around for marketing purposes.", "Women used to wear dresses/skirts. They still do, but they used to too. The design of the front half of a bike is referred to as the \"front triangle\" (the portion of the frame from the forks to the seatpost). Triangles are the strongest shape in nature because forced is added/displaced equally on all three sides. The step-through frame, generally regarded as a \"woman's\" bike was to allow a woman to get onto the bike while wearing a dress/skirt (they are different things). The ability to use a bicycle was hugely liberating for women when first introduced. While the step-through allowed women (and those with hip issues) the ability to get on a bike, structurally the frame is not as strong as the triangle (where the top tube is much higher). There was the [Penny in Yo Pants initiative]( URL_0 ), demonstrating a trick using pocket change to allow women in skirts to ride bicycles. There isn't really anything in cycling that is \"gender specific\". Men and womens seats now have options that have no center channel. Beyond that, it's just a matter of frame size - cranks, gears, wheels, handlebars (incl. tape) is a lot of personal preference and bike fit.", "I used to rent bikes. Low step are still good now particularly for people with hip or leg issues. I had an elder man renting specifically request the low step option for this reason. Also good for people who might lose their balance swinging a leg around, and of course, riding in compromising clothing. WSD options (low step) typically have a shorter distance from person to handle bars. This smaller space was built intentionally with women and their shorter wing span in mind. Personally I like having the bar there, and I do happen to have a longer wing span, so I typically take the male option of bikes."]}
{"prompt": "If coaxial is good enough to get the signal inside, why do we use all kinds of other connections (HDMI, Ethernet etc...)\nAn elaboration of the question: Had some new services installed in my home recently and realized that they used coaxial cable for every service (TV, phone, Internet). I remember coaxial always being used for the TV, but it used to be a cable that just went straight into the TV. Then it changed to a cable going in a box that then hooked up to the TV. Now its the same but the box connects via HDMI instead of coaxial. Internet same thing, coaxial runs into the modem and then uses ethernet cables after that. Phone has its own modem which also then uses regular phone like jacks and connectors. But if Coaxial is what is importing all these signals into the house in the first place, why not standardized everything to run through coaxial inside the house as well?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The coaxial signal is very high frequency analog. It takes significant electronics to decode it and encode an outgoing signal. The box that does this is called a modem (MOdulator-DEModulator). If you add that electronics to every thing, it would significantly increase the cost, over a digital system like HDMI. High frequency analog signals are also subject to cosite interference when you have more than one of them inside a box, so things would need lots of metal boxes to put the components in. Net result, it would cost a lot more.", "Because coax is essentially carrying radio signals, and anything working over it includes a full radio transceiver. Essentially it's much more similar to using wifi cards. You could replace your Ethernet connection with wifi cards connected via coax instead of antennas, it would probably work, but it's much more expensive than Ethernet, and significantly slower. It's a similar issue with HDMI, a current HDMI cable can be powered by a $25 raspberry pi zero (so whatever HDMI needs is less than that), but HDMI handles 48Gbps of data, much much more than your $100 cable modem is capable of. While a cable modem using current tech can be made to push 48Gbps over coax, it would really require 100 times the hardware to generate the right signals, making it a $10k modem, and you need one on each end of the cable.", "Because each of those things have specific standards (physical and electrical) that were developed independently - many of them prior to the introduction of consumer Internet services from cable TV companies. Phones, for example, have used the same cabling, modular connectors, and signalling for 40+ years. Could you run phones directly over coax? Sure, but what would the benefit be compared to the expense of abandoning millions of existing phones. Years ago, we used to run Ethernet over coaxial cable. However, coax tends to be bulky and hard to work with, and the devices used to propagate the signal introduce multiple failure points to the network. So, networking switched over to twisted pair cable in the late 80s/early 90s. TP wiring is easier to work with and is less expensive than coax. HDMI was developed in the early 2000s, to provide higher quality digital AV between devices. It's no coincidence that HDMI came on the heals of wider adoption of DVD, and was developed around the same time as Blu-Ray. Each of the standards is optimized for its specific function and, after the cable comes into your home, the signals the cable company sends must be converted, by your modem, into the type that can be used by the connected device.", "Another piece of insight here. From what I remember from college. The coaxial cable is essentially lossless. It can be run for miles and miles without signal degradation. You can't do that with ethernet. For simplicity sake, essentially you can't run Cat5e more than 100 meters (~300+ feet) at a time without a repeater to regenerate the signal and send it out again. Cat6 is the same at 1000base-T but it's more often used for 10GBase-T, or 10 gigabit per second rate, which means its maximum distance is about 55 meters. HDMI is the same story, topping out at 50 feet before signal degradation. [Here's a decent source]( URL_1 ) Notice the RG-59 Coax doesn't show a max length. IIRC from college, that's thanks to shielding and most importantly, impedance matching. [Wikipedia sources for support]( URL_0 ) Especially the \"matched load\" section there where it says \"for all l.\" If you tried to do the same thing that Coax is used for by using ethernet cables, it would cost you a fortune in repeaters alone. You can't do everything with Coax either. It has limits on splits. It's better for getting signal between 2 points, but not well suited for your network backbone like ethernet. There are pros and cons to all types of cables and their usefulness depends on application needs."]}

Now we use glasses without any coloration. How did this change happen? Did we discover new way to make 3D films?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The key idea of any 3d is to project 2 images on to the screen, and have each eye register only one of them. With red/blue, you would show one image in only blue color, and another image in only red color, using different shades of red. If you looked at the entirely-red-shades image through lens that was color red, you would see just, well, red. But if you saw it through blue lens, you would see all the different shades. Likewise for blue. Thus, you get(with wonky colors) 2 different images, one for each eye, which then could be used to do 3d. Modern tech however uses polarization, that is, the direction light is sorta \"waving\" at. Light is a wave, and it has direction, orthogonal to the direction it's going, where it's \"waving\" at. Typically white light does this waving thing in all sorts of directions, and it's a mess, but there are filters which can block all but certain orientation of this waving. Having one image transmitted only using light that's of certain orientation, and then have lenses of your glasses selectively block these orientations allows again you to transmit only one of the two images to both eyes. I don't know how expensive this new polarization technique is, but I can tell you that you can do pretty good job with this red/blue lens thing with very cheap materials, video device you use to show your red/blue 3d film has absolutely no special requirements, and it's pretty cheap to make appropriate glasses, so that probably explains why people historically did use this red/blue 3d thing despite color problems.", "Polarized light is the secret. To your eye, polarized light looks like normal light. Normal light has waves, right? Normally, these waves kinda bounce every which way. But with a filter, you can ensure the waves only go one way, for example vertical. So what the 3D projector does is show two images, one composed of vertically poliarized light, one of horizontally polarized light, on top of each other. One glasses lens filters the one polarization, and the other filters the other polarization. So each eye now sees a different image. [Here's a handy lil diagram]( URL_0 ). For the other lens, the opposite would be true, the horizontal light would get past the filter but the vertical would not."]}

In a room of the building, conneceted to the solar panels, are four large batteries. These batteries are similar to those you would find in a car but are larger and can store more electricity. The excess electricity not used by the building is pushed into and stored in these batteries. This means we can access that supply of electricity when the Sun is not in the sky or on cloudy days. In the event that the batteries were full and we weren't using any electricity, the solar panels system would stop generating electricity until it was needed again.", "Solar panels will act as a heater if the power is not used. Similar to how an engine that is not connected to anything will just make heat and noise. The electricity will just be heating up the wires and the panels themselves.", "It doesn't generate power that it doesn't use. Sunlight displaces electrons in the solar panel. If those electrons can't go anywhere then as each electron is moved there are fewer electrons left behind to move. Meanwhile the abundance of displaced electrons makes moving more electrons more-and-more difficult. Soon the sunlight is not moving any electrons at all. This is the same reason that batteries don't discharge (as fast) when the device they are in is turned off. It's also why your car battery might be _able_ to push \"500 cold-cranking amps\" but it is not normally moving anywhere near that much current. So the sunlight is a mechanical force.

If nothing is using that voltage... if no \"current\" is being drawn... then the forces of electricity and sunlight reach equilibrium and the cells do _nothing_. So if your building has the _potential_ to generate twice as much power as it uses... it still only _actually_ generates as much power as it uses, and the extra potential is just meaningless. What normally happens in such a design is that you add batteries to store some energy for darker times, or you hook up to the grid and generate 100% of your potential, use half, and sell the other half to the grid. In other terms, I can reasonably lift fifty pounds, but I rarely lift more than ten. It's improper to ask \"what happened to the other forty pounds\" because they don't exist. That forty pounds didn't \"go anywhere\". It was never there at all. Same for the capacity of the panels to generate XXX current. If you only use the lessor YY current, then that's all that's generated. Same for your house on the grid. The grid _could_ supply enough power to melt your entire house in bright electric arcs. But since you never ask it for that kind of power it never happens. (And we have circuit breakers and fuses that prevent that request being filled if you should have something break and so ask for that kind of power.) So that's why turning off appliances and lights \"saves power\" by eliminating the place where such power might go, and so eliminating its actual production. TL;DR :: Electricity, when it piles up has \"back-pressure\" because that's how \"electrical charge\" works. That back-pressure slows or stops the generation of electricity in solar panels so that only as much as you use can actually be generated."]}

Hypergolic means that the two substances react with each other nearly instantaneusly without any other input producing a flame that in turn will ignite the propellent and start the engine."]}
{"prompt": "Why do screws/bolts/nuts get loose and have to be tightened, in the first place?\nAn elaboration of the question: It happens so often, you have a mechanical problem because a bolt holding two things together has become loose, letting something wiggle around.

It doesn't ever seem there's any pressure on the join in the direction that would cause a screw to turn, but they're always farther down the threads than you left them.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["It can be caused by many different things. It has to do with motion of course. I have a wooden chair I use all the time. It squeaks and twists and after about 6 months a screw will fall out and I'll tighten them all up. It's just wear and tear really. Even on industrial machines rattling or a motor vibration will over time but very slowly push the screws out."]}

Usually expensive items have some sort of theft prevention device that consists of a large magnet that can only be removed at the registers; if you don't buy it, it's not removed, and sets the alarm off.", "So it seems no one actually answered both questions. The scanners are just cameras that look at a bar code and take the pattern of the white lines and converts them into a number that the computer can find in a database to match to a product. The different spacing and thicknesses change the value. The alarms at the door are scanning for rfid tags. They send out a radio signal that the rfid tags respond too. When the tags receive the signal they use it to power up a weak response signal that the alarms scan for. The magnets they swipe the tags over just wipe out the rfid tags."]}

{"prompt": "Technical debt\nAn elaboration of the question: what is this? A lot of my engineers at work talk/complain about it but I don't really understand the concept\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Technical debt is the software engineering buzzword for taking shortcuts that come back to bite you later. Now, maybe you *had* to take a shortcut to launch your thing on time, or maybe you're just a lazy POS. In my experience in software, it's a 50/50 mix. Here are some possible types of technical debt (not an exhaustive list): * Lack of tests. This is important for projects with large teams because the original author of some code isn't necessarily going to be there to review changes from other team members. The reason this is debt is because future well-intentioned changes could cause a regression in behavior, which will waste significantly more time with rolling back builds, finding culprit changelists, rolling back code (or fixing forward, not recommended 99% of the time), finding the bug, and rolling forward. * Poor encapsulation. Encapsulation is the idea that a chunk of code should be mostly self-contained, with anything not self-contained being established and documented. Think of it like an electrical system in a house: External influences are well documented (different plug types), the main logic lives in one spot (breaker box). However, let's now imagine that, because it was easier to do at the time and it saved construction time (somehow), the only way to reset your breaker box is to flush your toilet. This would be an example of poor encapsulation. (Now let's say you had to replace your toilet, and... oh no, you have to completely unwind your electrical system to be able to get at the toilet. Looks like a weekend project just became a 2 week project.) * Hacks. A hack is a form of a shortcut taken because it's trivially easy to do, even if not a great idea. [Here is an example of a hack outside of software.]( URL_0 ) This could be a fairly well-contained hack (like say calling a function that hits your server infinitely until it works instead of backing off if you detect an outage, since you just have to delete that one chunk of code and rewrite it), or it could be systemic (\"If I just give the whole application access to these bytes, it will be way easier to set them from all over the application,\" now you have to rewrite your whole application to fix it). Hacks are incredibly insidious in code, and often lead to more hacks. If a hack is fixed right away, then the cost of the hack was the time spent adding the hack plus the time spent doing it right. Often times, laziness or downward pressure from leadership results in people adding more hacks to work around existing hacks. If you wait long enough for more code to depend on the hack, now you have to spend the time to redo everything around it right, in addition to the spent doing the original thing right. I've seen many projects at my place of employment slowly die due to accruing technical debt. As it grows, your ability to get work done in a timely manner shrinks, until you're spending 3 months getting something done that should have taken a week at most.", "It's a common agile software term. When you start making part of a program before other parts, you do work (spend $) and you get a part of the software. Let's say it's 1/2 of the software. Later on, when you're figuring out the next chunk of software, you notice that 10% of the code you already made has to be redone. This \"technical debt\" of 5% of your project is a debt you took on (perhaps without intending to) when you implemented the first half of the code."]}

Why is this?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The fastest innovations in tech are in the area of computers and software. The reason innovation happens so fast in that space is that the cost to building and trying out an idea is so small. If you think of an idea, you can try it out and build it right away.

{"prompt": "How does an AA gun or a flak gun work?\nAn elaboration of the question: In movies where air battles or bombings occur there are typically anti air guns shooting up at the planes.

What determines when the flak round will explode, what causes the round to explode, etc.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Early models of flak shells had what /u/_YourPariah_ had. You figured out the altitude of the aircraft, then adjusted the timer on the shell to explode at the appropriate height. During the Second World War, the US and UK developed the Proximity Fuse, which worked like u/fofwalker says. Those shells detected an aircraft nearby and exploded. The new fuse was so secret, it was forbidden to use them on the continent for fear the Germans would get their hands on them. URL_0", "I believe there's a timer in the rounds. Since you know how fast the round travels, it's pretty easy to calculate X number of seconds equals y number of feet in the air.", "I'm no expert but I always thought that they had little radar devices inside of the rounds that would explode into shrapnel when near an airplane.", "*I'm assuming you're talking about large calibre flak (such as the 8.8cm) and not lower calibre anti-aircraft guns that work the same as normal guns.* Flak shells in WW2 had 2 types of fuses, either a timed fuse or a barometric fuse. The timed fuse is pretty self explanatory and detonates when the timer expired. The barometric fuse on the other hand detonated when a certain (set) altitude was reached.", "Timed fuzes, mostly. They generally knew what altitude the planes they were shooting at were flying, and how long it took for their rounds to reach that altitude, so they set a timer. The Allies also had proximity fuzes. They were essentially tiny radars that would detonate the shell when it got close. Very important to the war effort, almost on par with the atomic bomb.", "The shells they are firing up at the planes have an adjustable fuse that can be set before firing to explode at different altitudes.

{"prompt": "Why are radiators often located beneath window shelves?\nAn elaboration of the question: Seems to me like more heat would escape the room when the source is located in the least insolated part of the room, which furthermore has less mass to retain the heat than a wall. Or is my science incorrect? Please explain\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["you are almost right - it is usually the coldest spot in your room. But that also means, that this is the part of the room that is the hardest to heat. If you'd put the radiator at the other end of the room you'd have a very warm and cozy part of the room and the freezing part of the room right next to the windows. And to get the cold corner to a nice temperature you'd have to make the warm part of the room even warmer. Putting the radiator at the window leads to a more evenly distributed warmth in a room.", "There are many reasons why. As said already, it helps with the heat distribution of the room by creating a warm buffer near the window to help minimize heat loss. This pocket of warm air insulates the rest of the room from drafts coming from the outside. It also helps decrease the amount of condensation on the window by keeping it warm enough to not reach the dew point. Space is also something to consider. Normally the area below a window is unused space so it makes sense to place the radiator there rather than take up space on another wall."]}
{"prompt": "Why aren't cars more fuel efficient?\nAn elaboration of the question: The small Japanese family cars of the 1970s were pulling 30-40 miles per gallon on carbureted, naturally-aspirated engines that had to be throttled to produce any performance. Yet today, with direct injected, turbocharged, electronically managed engines, fuel efficiency remains pretty similar. What gives?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Things I learned during my Mechanical Engineering degree: * **Competing Factors**: Fuel efficiency isn't necessarily correlated with other positive attributes, like safety, cost, reliability, emissions, and engine characteristics. Designing a vehicle requires compromises between these factors. * **Emissions Standards**: Fuel emission standards need to be pretty universal. For example, Los Angeles is affected a lot more by high emissions than Denver, so car manufacturers abide by policies that lower emissions universally for the sake of L.A., even if it reduces fuel efficiency. It's an intertwining of politics and economics. For those who might be confused as to why fuel efficiency isn't always correlated to emissions: depending on several factors, an engine can emit different levels of various particulates, some of which are really damaging to the environment and public health."]}
{"prompt": "Pipeline regulations\nAn elaboration of the question: I understand oil spills are detrimental to our environment but so is transferring oil by truck.

It seems like better regulations/ punishment would be the solution. Why isn't that talked about more?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Depends on the country and the regulator, which also depends on where the pipeline is going to, and whether it's onshore or subsea. Here in Australia, you're required to develop a Pipeline Management Plan (PMP) that covers all aspects of the pipeline, e.g.: - Route planning. - Soil erosion and subsidence. - Thermal effects. - Construction (material selection, welding methodology, installation, compression and transmission, integrity verification). - Maintenance (corrosion control, inspection, non-destructive testing). - And, at the end, decommissioning and environmental reconstruction. As for are they doing enough, well, in most cases yes. The majority of pipeline discharges are unrelated to the pipeline itself. Most common is people drive into them, or drag marine anchors over them, or they get dislodged or damaged during severe weathers. Hell, in Nigeria, the locals come in and cut holes in them to steal buckets of oil out of the pipeline, and in more cases than not it blows them the hell up. BP's Alaska pipeline spill was a direct result of cost-cutting. They scaled back on their maintenance program (especially pigging - where you run essentially a drone down the pipe and check corrosion and wall thickness), the pipe corroded and pissed crude oil out of the ground."]}

It could withstand down to 4 °C but ambient temperatures were -2.2 to -1.7 °C. Ultimately the failure of the o-ring destroyed the craft. For the Columbia disaster a piece of foam insulation broke off the external tank and struck the left wing of the shuttle. This meter-long piece of foam broke off when the craft was traveling at about 2,600 kph and likely caused a 15-25 cm hole in the wing. Upon reentry into the atmosphere this gap in the shielding allowed hot gasses to enter the wing and destroy the craft."]}
{"prompt": "How do transistors work and be the size of a atom?\nAn elaboration of the question: I don't really understand how transistors work. I read they are like doors, if they are how is that any different then a switch? How can transistors be so small and still function, I read we can make single atom transistors and even subatomic transistors. Bonus question: I could be wrong but it seems the vacuum tube turned into the transistor. Are they wired and function the same way but a transistor is just smaller. Like moving from wires to PCB or entirely different.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The operation of a vacuum tube is a lot like a Field Effect Transistor (FET), but the actual mechanism of operation is a bit different. And the construction is very different. Transistors are \"solid state\"...there's no vacuum (or moving parts). So transistors are much more reliable and \"shrinkable\". One of the great things about transistors was that people figured out how to manufacture a bunch of them at the same time in a circuit configuration (an \"Integrated Circuit\", or IC). Then they figured out to make the whole circuit smaller, and smaller, and smaller. This is what enabled the microelectronics revolution over the last 50 years. Sometimes people describe transistors as little switches, but this is not quite accurate. They are actually little amplifiers, but we *use* them like little switches in digital electronics. (In analog electronics, we use them like little amplifiers, which is what they are.) In a FET, there are 3 connections. How much current passes between the Source and Drain connections is controlled by the voltage put on the Gate connection. (There's actually a 4th connection, but we can neglect it for this description.) So you can amplify a small signal by putting it on the Gate and letting it control a large current between the Source and Drain. In digital logic, you either put a very little voltage on the Gate, or a lot. So the SD current is either very little, or a lot. In this way, the transistor acts like a switch, except the switch isn't controlled by anything mechanical, it is controlled by the Gate voltage. The smallest transistor I've ever hear of is a [quantum dot]( URL_0 ), or perhaps a [single-electron transistor]( URL_1 ). These are still in their infancy, and I don't understand them enough to describe them. They don't really work like the ubiquitous FET that are in so many things today. In today's FETs, some of the materials are down to one atomic layer *thick*. But the whole transistor is still larger than an atom."]}
{"prompt": "why do you need a GFCI receptacle in wet places when it provides the same function as a circuit breaker?\nAn elaboration of the question: The magnetic part of a circuit breaker should trip when there's a short circuit. I fail to see how this is any different *in effect* than a \"ground fault\". Is it just the matter of it taking a few microseconds longer to react than a GFCI, or what?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["A circuit breaker trips when too much current is detected. Here \"too much\" is on the order of 15 *amps*. By the time the breaker trips it's far too late for the person being shocked. GCFI trips if the current imbalance exceeds a *much* lower value, around 0.006 amp.", "A circuit breaker only shuts off if excess current is drawn through it. In most cases a short circuit between the hot and neutral will cause excess current to flow causing the breaker to trip. If there is a short between the hot and ground, again it should cause the breaker to trip. However if there is a short between the hot and some other ground path outside of the circuit, it might not cause excess current to flow. This could still be incredibly dangerous because you can be seriously injured or killed from as little as 0.05A Most home circuits in the US are 15A. So as you can plainly see, the circuit breaker will do nothing to help in this case. The Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter on the other hand compares the current flowing through the hot to the current returning on the neutral. If the two are not the same, then some current must be leaking out of the circuit somewhere else and that is clearly a dangerous fault condition.", "A circuit breaker will trip on a fault current equal to the rated value in 10 or 15 minutes. An overload twice that would trip in a few seconds. A person will fry badly in that time. A GCFI trips in a few hundredths of a second. That's fast enough to prevent injury."]}

{"prompt": "What is the difference between the various semi-automatic gun mechanisms?\nAn elaboration of the question: I know roughly how they work (the expanding gas is used to push the slide or bolt back) but I have no idea the difference between short vs long blow back, blow forward, direct vs indirect impingement, recoil, etc. I can't find great visual differences, and the Wikipedia articles are pretty technical and assume that I know more about the internals than I do.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The most simple form is straight blowback Straight blowback works by having an unlocked bolt behind the round in the chamber. when the gun is fired the gas pressure exerts a force on the bolt and it is forced away from the chamber. As it moves rearwards the empty case is pulled out. When the bolt reaches the rear of it's travel it moves forward again using the force stored in the recoil spring. On the way forwards it strips a new round from the magazine and pushes it into the chamber ready to fire again. The main disadvantage of blowback firearms is that the only thing keeping the bolt in battery (against the chamber) is the inertia of the bolt. In order to be safe the case needs to be supported in the chamber until the pressure in the chamber has dropped (after the bullet has left the barrel). As the power of the round being fired increases the mass of the bolt must increase. Delayed blowback is similar in operation except there will be some mechanism that will increase the inertia of the bolt without adding mass. For example the roller delayed blowback system used in the HK MP5 sub machinegun and G3 rifle or the lever delayed system used in the FAMAS rifle. The mechanism generally works by having a two part bolt having some method of forcing one half to move faster than the bolt face thus giving the bolt assembly more inertia than a one piece bolt of the same mass. Blow forward is the opposite of blowback. The bolt is in a fixed position and the drag of the bullet travelling through the barrel pulls the barrel forwards off the empty case. As the barrel reaches the end of it's forward travel the empty case is ejected and the barrel returns under spring pressure. As it travels back it collects a new round and chambers it. This method of operation is extremely rare and was only used in a few firearms Recoil operation means that when the gun is fired the bolt and barrel both move backwards together. This gives the bullet more time to leave the barrel than a blowback design. There are two main types of recoil operation: short recoil and long recoil. Short recoil operation means that the barrel and bolt are locked together when in battery and only travel a short distance before the barrel unlocks from the bolt. After this happens the barrel stops and the bolt continues. The empty case is ejected and the bolt returns forward collecting a new round and chambering it. The bolt gets to the barrel and moves it forward into the locked position ready to fire again. Most semi-auto pistols use a short recoil action with a browning tilting barrel design which works by locking the barrel into the slide via locking lugs above the chamber. As the barrel moves rearward it drops down which disconnects it from the slide. For example see the 1911. Other short recoil systems include the toggle locked (luger pistol) and rotating barrel (gsh18, beretta px4). Long recoil operation means that when the gun is fired both the bolt and barrel travel all the way to the end of travel. At this point the bolt stays at the rear and the barrel returns to the forward position. When the barrel slides off the empty case which is held by the bolt the case is ejected and the bolt then moves forward collecting a new round and chambering it. An example of this is the Browning A5 shotgun. Gas operated firearms use tap some gas from a port in the barrel and use it to operate the gun. Gas operated firearms can be put into 2 categories: direct impingement and piston operated. Direct impingement firearms work by blowing gas directly at the bolt carrier which then moves rearward unlocking the bolt and ejects a round. For example the AG m/42 rifle. An alternative is the system used in the AR10 and AR15 rifle which is where gas is tapped off the barrel and directed into the bolt carrier via the gas key. Once inside the carrier it expands in the space behind the bolt (which has a gas piston and rings at the rear) causing the bolt carrier to move rearward and unlock the bolt and then carry it the the rear. If memory serves this system was originally called an \"expanding gas system\" but is usually called direct impingement now. Gas piston systems work by directing gas from the barrel and using it to push a piston which moves the bolt carrier to operate the firearm. There are two types: short stroke and long stroke systems. Short stroke is where the piston only travels a short distance just enough to give the bolt carrier a kick which sets it into motion. Examples of this are the HK G36 rifle, FN SCAR rifle and the Steyr Aug Rifle. Long stroke is where the piston is attatched to the bolt carrier and travels all the way to the rear and all the way forward again. For example the AK47 rifle and M1 Garand rifle. Two different ways that the bolt can unlock are by tilting or rotating. All the rifles I mentioned previously as examples of gas piston systems all have rotating bolts. Examples of tilting bolts are the VZ58 rifle and the FN FAL. Other actions exist too, I forget the name but there is a gun that used a combination blow forward/blow back action. Also check out the Mateba auto revolver."]}

{"prompt": "Why does such an important feature as a planes transponder not work like the planes flight data recorder and be much harder to turn off and have it's own backup power supply?\nAn elaboration of the question: I understand the FDR can be removed from the planes power supply by removing the circuit breaker, but it will then use it's own local power supply. Why does the transponder seem have a less strict \"up time\" policy applied to it by it being able to be turned off and having no localised power supply?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Because the transponder isn't as critical to the operation of an airplane. The main purpose of a transponder is to make it easier for air traffic control to tell which airplane is which, and to relay altitude information. If the transponder fails, the pilot has to verbally relay that information, which slows things down. But a plane can land just fine without a transponder. A transponder is not designed for locating a plane after a crash. It can be used that way in an emergency if it survives the crash, but that is not what it is for. Finally, if a transponder becomes faulty, it can broadcast bad information and interfere with other aircraft, so it is important for a pilot be able to turn it off as necessary."]}

I can't see the burglar hiding behind my ottoman no matter how hard I squint, unless I move my position. So then how does a fixed-position radar build this top-down view? How does it discriminate between the front side of a cloud, the back side of a cloud, the sides of the cloud, the sides of the cloud behind that, etc.? Right now in my area there are like hundreds of layers of clouds just in one direction. I look at the map top-down and I can see how a radar could figure it out from my earth-orbit POV, but the radar is on the ground, not in space. I can't imagine every beam is able to report its complete itinerary back to the station like \"I bounced from position A to B ... to Z and then finally back to you for good\"...so how does this work?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["> I can't imagine every beam is able to report its complete itinerary back to the station like \"I bounced from position A to B ... to Z and then finally back to you for good\"...so how does this work? And yet it does! Or, more exactly, the radar shoots out a pulse. Then it opens its eyes and starts looking for reflections. Every nanosecond it sees how much of a reflection it gets. And because it knows how fast light travels, and of course it knows what direction it's looking in, it knows where that reflection came from. (It knows that it must be a direct reflection because it looks at the strongest signal it got, which is practically speaking almost impossible to be a multipath reflection). If it gets a strong reflection 50,000 nanoseconds after it emits the pulse, it knows it's hitting a cloud at about 25,000 feet away (light travels about 1 foot in 1 nanosecond)."]}
{"prompt": "what in the audio jack’s design makes the iPhone more prone to water damage than the lightning port?\nAn elaboration of the question: One reason that’s cited for getting rid of the audio jack on smartphones is that the audio jack makes them especially vulnerable to water damage. But there are other orifices on smartphones, too. On the iPhone there’s the lightning port millimetres from the audio jack. How is the lightning port doing better when it comes to water damage?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["> But there are other orifices on smartphones, too. Whenever you have a port in a container such as a smartphone the efforts to secure it against water intrusion are going to have a certain rate of failure. Whatever the rate is the fewer ports the lower the risk to the device as a whole. Obviously they can't get rid of the lightning port but if lightning can do everything the 3.5 mm audio jack can do then removing it would be expected to lower rates of water damage. Note that this holds true regardless of if the audio port is any easier to secure against water or not. I think there are more compelling arguments in favor of the move though. For example the lightning port has the potential to provide superior sound quality compared to a normal audio jack. Why? The lightning port can provide external power to connected devices by drawing from the internal battery. This can power amplifiers and various audio processing hardware in the connected devices, as well as things like active noise cancelation which would otherwise require power storage integrated into the devices themselves at the cost of increased weight, the cost of complexity, and the need to charge more devices. Obviously something like USB-C might be an even better solution but the lightning cable has been around for four years now while USB-C is still picking up steam."]}

Today on earth we rely heavily on GPS to navigate around or via maps created with satellites or drawn by hand (ancient).

I guess putting satellites around the planet is one way to do it but imagine it won't be cost effective or great way to spend resources if we intend to get around ;-).

{"prompt": "What's counter torque and why is it needed to make a helicopter fly?\nAn elaboration of the question: I once asked someone about how propellers can make an object fly. He said that without counter torque, no helicopter can fly no matter how fast the propeller was spinning. So what exactly is counter torque?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["A helicopter flies by using an engine to spin a primary rotor, but that rotor has inertia so when trying to spin it there is a force pushing back that tries to spin the helicopter body too. Counter torque is provided by the tail rotor and ensures that only the main rotor rotates around the shaft and the body of the helicopter isn't also spinning around the shaft. This is why a helicopter that loses the tail rotor starts spinning out of control", "Remember Newton's third law of motion? Each action has an equal and opposite reaction. Imagine a helicopter with no tail rotor, and the main rotor spins counter clockwise. The helicopter's body will spin opposite to the helicopter's blades. So without a tail rotor, the body will just keep turning clockwise. In order to stabilize the body from turning in circles constantly, the tail rotor provides a force that pushes the helicopter's tail counter-clockwise, balancing out the torque provided by the main rotor. [Here's a video on YouTube that provides a visual example and explains the mechanics behind a tail rotor.]( URL_0 ) There are helicopters without tail rotors, but they have some sort of mechanism at the tail that produces the same effect a tail rotor does: provide a force at the tail opposite the helicopter's spin.", "People here are mixing up the air resistance of the rotor with the torque from the engine. The torque that makes the helicopter spin comes from the engine spinning the rotor. If the rotor spins and is braked by air resistance no torque is applied to the body. This is actually very important, as it allows you to do an autorotation (landing without engine power) if the tail rotor fails. . Also there are helicopter designs that do fly without any sort of tail rotor or torque compensation. E. G. You can pump gas through the blades, that comes out at the tip of the blade pointing backwards. This induces no torque on the body URL_0", "The main rotor is constantly cutting into the air in one direction. If there was nothing bracing the body of the helicopter it would start turning in the other direction. Just like if you try to push something heavy while standing on a slippery surface you could go backwards, instead of pushing the object forward. A helicopter has a vertical rotor on the back to counter the spinning of the main rotor."]}
{"prompt": "How does the accelerator pedal in cars work?\nAn elaboration of the question: I have two theories in my mind but they can be both wrong. 1st theory: When the pedal is pushed a little, the car accelerates and then remain at a certain constant speed if the pedal is maintained at the same position. If the pedal is pushed further, the car accelerates and then remain at a higher constant speed as long as the pedal is maintained at the same position. 2nd theory: When the pedal is pushed a little, the car keeps accelerating at a slow rate and speed keeps changing at a slow rate. If the pedal is pressed further, the car keeps accelerating at a faster rate and speed keeps changing at a fast rate.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["In most cars, pushing the accellerator (or gas ) pedal increases the flow of fuel to the engine. This means the engine will output more power, causing the car to accellerate. However, this accelleration doesn't continue forever. Mainly because as a car's speed increases, the amount of wind resistance increases as well, that's like a force pushing against the car forcing it to slow down. So when you press the accellerator, the engine will push the car harder, and as it speeds up, the air will push harder against it. Once they reach an equilibrium, the car stops accellerating and instead maintains a constant speed.", "In new cars it's electronic. You push it and it tells the engine how much gas and oxygen to let in (for combustion). Older cars have a cable attached to the pedal that connects to the throttle body (lets air in the engine). My pushing the pedal it in return pulls the cable and opens the throttle body butterfly valve. More oxygen = more power, so the more you push the pedal the more oxygen gets sucked in which in turn accelerates the car."]}
{"prompt": "How does a jet engine provide reverse thrust when landing?\nAn elaboration of the question: I searched but didnt really find a proper explanation (though i may be using the wrong terms) I look out the window and I see that the shrouding of the engine kind of folds back to the outlet of the jet and I guess maybe redirects it forward... Ok... but isnt all of that air its redirecting being sucked in from the front to begin with? So even if the redirection were 100% efficient (surely not) it would be a net zero thrust? So where does the reverse thrust actually come from? bonus question, how much good does it actually do? I mean... seems like it must be a fair amount of complexity and weight on the aircraft, plus the token amount of fuel, to shave a few feet off the landing distance? Wouldnt it be better to just let the existing brakes do the job if the runways can contain it? (or cant they?)\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Jet engines work by dramatically increasing the speed of air flowing through them, using a fairly simple design. Air flowing into the front of the engine exits the back at a much increased speed. This is why engines can generate thrust from a standstill. When \"target type\" thrust reversers are deployed, they redirect the flow of the gas exiting the engine to point it in the direction of travel, which results in reverse thrust and slowing of the aircraft. Regarding why they are used - several reasons. Firstly to reduce the wear on brakes, thus avoiding potential failures; secondly to reduce the landing distance; and thirdly to compensate for the negative effect of poor weather on braking efficiency."]}
{"prompt": "How do sailboats / ancient ships steer if the wind isn't blowing in the direction they want to go?\nAn elaboration of the question: Forgive me if my terminology is off. But I've always wondered how long voyages were made given the unpredictable pattern of winds. How are ships able to go where they want if the wind is, say, blowing in the wrong direction?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["A sail can catch wind and push the boat forward from just about any angle greater than 70 degrees from directly in to the wind. A sail boat has a big fin on the bottom that keeps it from being pushed sideways, and the sail is at an angle so the wind is redirected, which all together pushes the boat forward. So as long as the boat isn't going directly into the wind, it can often just sail straight forwards in the direction it wants to go. If the boat wants to travel in to the wind, then what the boat does is it picks up speed going across the wind, and then turns into the wind. While the boat is facing in to the wind, the sail is not catching the wind, so there is much less force trying to slow the boat down as it turns. AS the boat loses speed, it will turn far enough that it is going sideways to the wind again, but in the other direction- and once it picks up enough speed again, it will turn back in to the wind again, which creates a zig-zag pattern that slowly moves them in the direction they want to go. This is known as Tacking in to the wind. Depending on how close to directly in to the wind they want to go, they could just go in mostly the right direction, hoping that the wind will shift in their favor and then tack in to the wind to correct their position once in a while if the wind doesn't change.", "It's called tacking, and basically you zig zag using a portion of the wind to move in the direction you want... so if you were sailing directly into the wind you'd angle the sail so that it moves you up at a 45 degree angle, then switch and have to move you down at a 45 degree angle", "No one yet seems to have mentioned the keel. The keel runs from the front to the back of a boat. The wind, when from the side, just wants to blow the boat sideways, it is the keel that stops that from happening and thus the boat is sort of \"squeezed\" forwards a bit like when you squeeze a toothpaste tube. The toothpaste is channelled by the sides into coming out the front. Same idea."]}

Snap your fingers to the right of your head. Now snap your fingers to the left of your head. [Even if your eyes were closed]( URL_1 ), you would be able to tell which direction the sound was coming from. This is due to **time of arrival differences** of the sound waves. The sound hits one ear or the other milliseconds before the other. Your brain interprets those time of arrival differences and figures out which direction the sound is coming from. With two speakers, or headphones, this is used to make sound appear to come from the far left, panning all the way through the center to the far right. There is no effect to produce \"depth\" using only two speakers. In the 70's, you began to see quadraphonic systems being sold: 4 speakers. This lets the audio engineers pan forward/back in addition to left/right. Quadraphonic setups are better known today as surround sound, where it's not 4 speakers but 5 plus a subwoofer: 5.1. Or 7.1.

I work as a web developer. But as I work for a small company, I just can't fathom data this big. Any insider knowledge, anecdotes and discussion from anyone who works on large databases would be appreciated. Edit: Went to bed, woke up and the blew up. Thanks for all the great discussion, and thanks for the gold.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The good news is that data isn't stored in one giant table. It is actually made up of multiple tables. Tools exist that then link those tables and read the information in them fairly effeciently. Oracle, MySQL, etc handle massive amounts of data pretty easily. Because these tools don't actually care what the data is, they just need the reference points, they can quickly retrieve the data. Think of how RAM works: fast switching pointers. This is how you get a user's data out of billions in a table. The software doesn't need to know that the person's first name is JOHN, it just needs to know that that user's pointer is here and it points to that table and then that table points to the next connected bit of data, etc. It is a chain of tables. Again, most of the retreival of the data isn't getting ALL of the data, it is just getting the pointer. That pointer leads to the next pointer, and so forth. Just fast swapping pointers and then one DISPLAY of the data. Big Data as it is termed, is a huge industry specifically for this challenge. It isn't perfect, but an entire industry exists simply to find better ways to store data so that that pointer chain can be processed faster and faster.", "The simplest answer to your question is that the billions of users (and trillions of other pieces of data associated with those users) are stored on a database split across thousands of machines. Every piece of information has an ID associated with it, and each ID maps to a particular portion of the database hosted by a particular set of machines responsible for that portion of the database. Software abstractions allow you to fetch the data associated with various IDs efficiently without worrying about the details of how the data are stored across the machines. If you want more details on Facebook in particular, a good starting point is to look into things they've written about TAO, a system they built on top of MySQL and memcache to manage their distributed data store.", "Background: I work with data for a living. You mentioned the word \"big\", and that's really appropriate here because some data can't be stored on a single logical volume (disk drive). Think of a standard database like a file system on your hard drive. Each element of the database has an index, and you can query the disk via index to retrieve records, kind of like accessing a file on your computer. The database engine keeps a record of where each bit of data is stored, so it can fetch them on request. What happens when you have so many records that indexing them becomes impossible? For example, you might have far more data than can fit on a single drive. Or you might have so many dimensions to your data that indexing it properly becomes too computationally expensive. This is where we transition into \"big data\". Big Data refers to database storage systems that help manage very large or very dimensional data structures. This happens by storing the data itself across multiple drives / volumes, and creating aggregated indexes or \"nodes\" to slice the data for retrieval. The actual mechanics of this can be pretty complicated, but there are drop-in solutions like Hadoop to streamline the process. Depending on how quickly you want the data retrieved, how deep the data is, how many simultaneous calls you expect, and a host of other factors, you'll set the number of nodes accordingly to balance cost (each new aggregation requires disk space and horsepower) and function (more nodes = faster retrieval). You might be surprised by what data actually qualifies as \"big\" data. With proper indexing and partitioning, a SQL DB can handle millions upon millions of records without flinching. On the other hand, a poorly optimized DB can result in slow read times and clunky operation with just a few million transactions. Data is neat!", "Big Data Engineer here. The ELI5 answer is that your data is replicated to multiple machines in easier to handle chunks. Say you have a table with 100 rows. What Facebook does is splits these tables into 5 machines each holding 60 rows. \"But wait, that's 300 rows. Why did my data increase?\" Well because if we had a unit of data in just one place, then you create a bottleneck. If everyone was viewing Elon Musk's FB page, then the one machine with Elon's page wouldn't be able to handle traffic for the other 19 people. By duplicating the data, Elon's FB page can be stored on three different machines. Finally, you have one more machine that routes incoming requests for data. \"Looking for Elon Musk's page? Go to machine A. TheNak1123's page? Go to Machine B. Elon again? Go to Machine C.\" The key point to remember is that storage is cheap. A 1 TB hard disk costs a consumer like you or me 50 bucks. The key resource for these companies is time. By throwing money to buy more computers and splitting up the data, Facebook can efficiently organize and use large quantities of data on the scale of Exabytes (Millions of Terabytes).", "My area of interest also. They have new types of databases that do not store data in row format(NoSQL) this removes the performance constraints on storing such data in a relational database. They also do not use one database but what you get is api's pulling data from many sources e.g there could be a Ugandan facebook user db only. Facebook is the creator of new frameworks such as presto which enable speedy access to data.", "Recognize that 1 billion users is really just a Google and Facebook problem and maybe a handful of others. The basic pieces of relational databases, if used properly, ensure that most of the time you don't actually need to store whole records. You store the bits that are unique and then just keep links to the bits. Then you make sure that you never ask questions that require you to scan the entire database. Think about a library. You don't have to look at every single book to find something specific. You look up the book in the catalogue, get the books call number and then go right to the specific shelf you need. Databases work this way too. The library catalogue is a database index. For those rare cases when you do want to browse in a library, you don't pick random shelves, you arrange the shelves in sections that have books of the same type. So you can browse, but not the whole library. For databases this is partitioning or sharding. Lastly, modern databases can do some special things with indexes when you're not looking for individual records but you want to count things. Most analytics queries aren't actually for individual records but for aggregates. You can define views and indices on particular types of aggregates so that asking those kinds of questions is more like going to one specific shelf in a library instead of scanning all the books one by one. You need good database design, good database admin, and in very rare circumstances brand new tech.", "Layers upon layers of caching, prefetching and denormalized views.

Let's say it's 1000 pieces for a given table; those 1000 pieces are actually on 1000 different servers. Some kinds of systems query this by having a map of which categories are stored on which servers. For example, your username begins with \"abc\", users with \"abc\" are on server database-a. Then you can query database-a for the actual result. This only works with some kinds of data. Some kinds of systems instead send the query to _all 1000 servers_. Since each server only has a small set of data to look through, they can answer relatively quickly, and then the querying software can further comb through the returned results, which leads to getting useful results very quickly. A very common way to do this is [MapReduce]( URL_0 ).", "Hey! I can answer this question. So large data sets, like you see at Facebook or Netflix, are typically stored in a *horizontally scaling* database like Cassandra. Horizontal scaling means that to increase the performance of the database you just add more computers (which I'll call machines from here on out). How does this work? Well, Cassandra is a distributed database system. This means the entire data set is contained on a bunch of different machines, not just one. This is called a cluster. All the machines in the cluster talk to each other to make sure they're all in sync. And when somebody requests data, they can do so from any one of the machines in the cluster. Every time data is saved to the database, we specify what's called a *primary key*. This tells Cassandra exactly which one of the many machines to save the data to. This makes searching faster because we not only break up the large sets of data, but we know exactly where that data sits in the cluster. Think of a primary key as your zip code. We also specify a *clustering key*, which is used to tell Cassandra how to sort all the data on an individual machine. Think of the clustering key as your home address. With the primary key and the clustering key, Cassandra can very quickly find the data you're looking for. To make searching faster, all you have to do is add another machine to the cluster. This decreases the amount of work each machine has to do individually. This is the key concept behind horizontal scaling. Apple, for instance, has about 1000 machines in their cluster. Hope I didn't butcher my explanation.

Caching is another strategy. The fact that you went to your 2010 records probably made some literal hard drives spinning somewhere. But if you are browsing your wall, that was served from fast RAM in a memcache or similar process.

There are lots of kinds of databases, so the exact solution varies a lot whether you use what's commonly referred to as a relational database (Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL Server), to document databases (MongoDB, CouchDB), graph databases (Neo4J, Atlas), to triple stores (Redland, AllegroGraph, DB2, Jena). But regardless of the kind of database, and the amount of data stored - the trick to storing vast amounts of data is having an efficient way to organize the data in a way you plan to access it. Say you have huge quantities of LEGOS. They come in lots of shapes, sizes, and colors. In order to effectively build something quickly - you need to organize the blocks in a way that makes it easy for you to find. Say you want to build a pile of parts in single color? Well you might just create bins of legos only organized by color since you only care about the color of the part. But then let's say you want to build a tower that uses only 2x6 bricks. You then might organize by shape instead. However what if you needed to build an entire structure that used a specific \"recipe\" calling for specific size, color, shape and quantity of bricks? You might then have a bin for each style of brick, sorting bricks that are of the same shape, color, and size in the same pile. Then organize the piles in a way that you could quickly locate any specific part in quantity very fast. This might be keeping all the same colored bricks close together and organizing those piles from small to large shapes. Big Data is handled no differently. One creates an index into the data in a manner that is equivalent to the way you will search. So regardless of the type of DB system used, if you are searching using color, size, and shape, you create an index of only those things color, size, and quantity with a reference to where the entire piece of data resides.", "High traffic sites are not a simple client-server-database architecture, you have many more components that help deal with the massive amounts of requests that are sent their way. The most useful tools for scaling are ( listed alphabetically ). 1. Caching - avoid hitting the computes as much as possible let the cache handle it 2. CDN (content delivery network) - let the CDN take as much load from their origin and let the edge nodes take take care of it 3. Layering - Put in as many layers as necessary to have resiliency for example, have a layer of servers that detect where the request is coming from ; if request comes from mobile send it to a different service stack than if it comes from desktop or if it as API request etc. Also consider caching at each layer of the stack 4. Load balancing - use as many load balancers as necessary. It is always a good idea to put your servers and databases behind a load balancer When it comes specifically to the database layer, data in database is typically put in different databases based on logical usage. For example, there could it be database hosted on a bunch of linux hosts that stores only user authentication information. There would be another database hosted on many hosts that stores all the posts user has created. This is done for multiple reasons, one of which is that there are limits to the number of connections a database can open before it runs out of connections another reason can be that the type of database used for one usecase might not be the best solution for another type. For example, RDBMS is not a great for transactional data but not so great at analytical data like analyzing social networks etc, you would want to use a graph database for that. And ofcourse, within each logical separation, you can will have the data in the database optimized using partitioning, normalization and indexing etc. Other redditors here have explained this in enough detail, so I am not going to repeat. You can also have multiple logical instance (where each logical instance is a pool (a pool is a collection of single machines or hosts) of database servers on a Solaris/AIX/Linux/Windows etc server), where you might have 10 instances that are read-only and only 1 instance where new data gets written and synced read only instances of the database - how often does a user update their facebook password or username vs how often do they login ? Using the above mentioned tools, architects come up with systems that serve massive traffic. How you use these depends on what your usecase is, analyzing your user behavior on your website and your server/data center capacity etc, which a lot of times boils down to how much will you be reading and how much will you be writing at it logical layer. And if your abstract all these ideas high enough, the main idea here is to to *divide and conquer*. The key is to figure out *what you need conquering* and *how you want to divide* in order to conquer... So I guess that's the ELI5 answer ? ***divide and conquer***.

Every once in a while I get a call in the middle of the night to add another 1TB to a 227TB database... The real answer is indexing, how you organize your data, and technologies like Oracle text, hadoop, and other stuff like that. 8 Billion rows in a table is not out of this world. The best way is to break the data down into pieces (tables) to the point that it's almost annoying. Everything get's an ID and that ID is indexed in it's respective table. Retrieving a ID which is a unique number, is very easy and almost instantaneous. Consider the following case: You are a company that receives computer files and extracts all of the details about each file into a searchable database so that you can easily determine which files are import and which ones are not. If you think about a file, there are lots of important properties you can keep track of and the data is called Metadata. You have: File Size, File Extension, Date Modified, Date Created, Mime-Type, Original File Path, File Name, Directory Name, etc... then you start getting into file type specific attributes... for Microsoft Office files you have Author, Document Title, A flag for Encrypted or not, Office has it's own Date Created and Modified values, version of the document format... I could go on and on and on... when you add emails you can literally have hundreds and hundreds of potential metadata fields. When you have a database of several hundred million files, that can add up to several billion rows of metadata very quickly. So how do you get all the metadata for a file? Let's Look: First you start off with a really simple table: DocumentID| Bates -----|---------- 23459872345 | Some formatted number a person can easily keep track of 23459872346 | PEIGHT-3548-3405 Then you have a table with all of the metadata fields to ID's MID | Description ---|--- 1 | FileName 2 | File EXT 3 | DateMod 4 | DateCreated Now.... how do you organize the actual metadata? Let's look at a table with the metadata for 4 files ID | DocumentID | MID | Value --|----------|---|----- 1 | 23459872345 | 1 | Awwwyeah.gif 2 | 23459872345 | 2 | gif 3 | 23459872345 | 3 | 5/27/2017 02:33 4 | 23459872345 | 4 | 5/27/2017 02:33 5 | 23459872346 | 1 | 06 - the world is mine - david guetta.mp3 6 | 23459872346 | 2 | mp3 7 | 23459872346 | 3 | 12/28/2016 03:12 8 | 23459872346 | 4 | 5/27/2017 03:12 9 | 23459872347 | 1 | IP schema.xlsx 10 | 23459872347 | 2 | xlsx 11 | 23459872347 | 3 | 9/18/2017 01:00 12 | 23459872347 | 4 | 1/1/2017 18:36 13 | 23459872348 | 1 | patch panel plan.xlsx 14 | 23459872348 | 2 | xlsx 15 | 23459872348 | 3 | 10/9/2016 03:41 16 | 23459872348 | 4 | 10/8/2016 23:55 So how do you get all the metadata from a specific file? In the large table the ID column and the document ID column are indexed. So you would search that table by document ID and 4 rows would be returned. If you just wanted the file extension you would throw an AND in there and you would want MID = 2. This is a very simplistic search and explination, but that's how it would work. The real question is.... how do you backup a 227TB database? You don't... you keep it in triplicate using different technologies...."]}

It has a special property of converting different Energies. With pressure it turns into heat, with light it splits light, and with electricity it creates a vibration. Some quartz crystals make a very stable vibration. Imagine one of these quartz could do 1000 times the second perfectly. We learned how to measure that has had to turn that into a clock. You may be familiar with counting seconds as one one thousand or one alligator. Running electricity through a piece of quartz crystal splits one second into to one thousand beats per second. By making a device that can separate every 1000 beats we can create a stable clock.", "Typical household digital clocks do not rely on quartz crystals for timekeeping. These clocks sample the AC voltage from the wall outlet. The frequency of this voltage is very well controlled at 50 or 60 Hz (varies by country) The clock measures the passage of time by counting how many times the electricity cycles. After 50 or 60 cycles, one second has gone by and the clock updates the display accordingly. The power distribution company strives to keep the frequency correct since varying frequency has a negative impact on the performance of the grid. The clock is incredibly accurate because of this. Interestingly, old style electric motor clocks also exhibited high accuracy for the same reason. In this case, though, a synchronous motor is used that spins once for each voltage cycle. 50 or 60 revolutions then equated to one second, so time could be mechanically displayed very accurately."]}

Larger tires will cause your speed to be faster than your speedometer says, and smaller tires will cause you to be slower.", "The old analog gauges used a cable from the transmission to the speedometer. The cable was a long flexible wire inside a housing. The cable would connect to a small gear adapter that connected to the transmission. As you drive the transmission would spin the gears in the adapter this would spin the cable which would spin the speedometer. On modern cars there is a speed sensor on the transmission. It consists of a magnet and a metal toothed ring .As the ring spins it creates a current in the magnetic sensor the speedometer uses this signal to display the correct speed. Tachometers used a cable attached to a rotating part on the engine such as the camshaft. Then they used an electrical signal from the ignition coil. Now they use the same type of sensor as the speedometer. There are usually two sensors that tell the engine computer how fast the engine is spinning. The camshaft and crankshaft sensors. The tachometer uses the signal from one or both of these sensors to display the rpm."]}

Cold working typically creates internal stresses.", "Previous answers are correct. If you mash a piece of metal that's cold, you create microscopic weak points in it, as you are basically ripping apart tiny crystals (extra-strong solid regions) that form within the metal.

Sometimes you can change it's shape by hitting it with a hammer, sometimes you can bend it by hand. Doing this is called working the metal.

{"prompt": "Why is the current in a series circuit with multiple loads constant throughout the circuit? How do the electrons \"know\" to send less current in a circuit with more loads?\nAn elaboration of the question: My teacher explained this concept using Kirchoff's Current Law: since all the current entering a load must come out, a series circuit cannot have different currents in different parts of the circuit. Here's where I get confused: If I hook up a 5V battery to a 1 Ohm resistor, I get 5A of current in my circuit. However, the moment I add another 1 Ohm resistor \"downstream\" of the first resistor, I get 2.5 A of current everywhere in the circuit, even \"upstream\" of the first resistor. Since I'm thinking about this with the water analogy, I'm confused by how the battery \"knows\" that there's an extra load and it better send only half the current. Essentially, I guess my question is how the electron flow automatically changes to fit whatever load is in the circuit.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The battery doesn't know anything, the amount of current is determined by the load If i put a 20 pound backpack on you and tell you to go for a run as fast as you can you'll make it in some certain speed If i put an 80 pound backpack on you and tell you to go for a run as fast as you can you'll be going much slower Would it be because you thought \"I am moving more load so i should run slower\" or because you aren't strong enough to move that larger load at the same speed(hint, its the second one) Same thing happens for the electrons. If you put more resistance in the circuit it is harder for them to squeeze around the circuit. Series devices all share the same current because an electron can't move forward without pushing another out of the way so you end up with the same number moving into the battery as out of the battery That last bit works like a straw. If i give you a big straw to blow down its not too challenging, there is some resistance. Now pinch the middle and try to blow, its a lot harder and you can't get as much air through even with more force, that's increased resistance. You're not choosing to get less work done because there is resistance, the resistance is causing you to get less work done", "> Since I'm thinking about this with the water analogy, I'm confused by how the battery \"knows\" that there's an extra load and it better send only half the current. Batteries don't send current. Batteries are a voltage source and (ideally) provide a fixed voltage regardless of the load. For the water analogy, how does a watter tower or pump station know to send more water to your garden hose when you swap the nozzle from the from the wide open high flow one to the narrow low flow one? It doesn't, it just provides a fixed pressure and whatever happens with flow happens. If you open a really really big valve, you will greatly increase flow and cause a pressure drop all the way along the pipe back to the source. The pressure wave travels at the speed of pressure waves, also known as sound. > Here's where I get confused: > If I hook up a 5V battery to a 1 Ohm resistor, I get 5A of current in my circuit. However, the moment I add another 1 Ohm resistor \"downstream\" of the first resistor, I get 2.5 A of current everywhere in the circuit, even \"upstream\" of the first resistor. It doesn't the moment you add a new resistor. He skipping what is known as the transient state and going to the next steady state. He's skipping the actual change process and telling you how it will end up. Let's say we swap a very very fast acting instantaneous switch that makes the resistance somewhere in the circuit higher. At that instant, the electrons in that new resistor, and that new resistor only, start to encounter more resistance and slow down. The rest of the circuit is unaffected. Next, the electrons before the new resistor start to catch up to the slowed down one. Current is higher upstream than it is down stream at this instance. They are like charges, so they repel each other. Them getting closer together is building up a voltage repelling then from getting any closer to each other. This creates a kind of back log, and will propogate backwards upstream all the way to the battery. On the downstream side, thanks to these slowed electrons, the ones ahead of then get further and further ahead. This gap of missing electrons (which are negative) is positively charged and wants to pull these electron back. This also propogates further downstream all the way to the battery. They'll be tugging back and forth and the current will fluctuate up and down all along the circuit as all things try to equalize. Current will not be equally everywhere, in places you will be building up or depleting charge to accomodate this. Eventually, this rippling in the current will settle down to zero and you will have a new steady current in your circuit, the one your teacher is telling you about that obeys KCL. How fast do these changes propogate at? Effectively the speed of light, that's why you can't notice them. The electrons attract and repel each other because they are electrically charged. Electrical chrages interact through voltages and electric field. Speed of light is just the speed a changing electric field propogates at in a vacuum. Inside of a wire is a little slower, but not far off. How long does this transient period last for? Probably millionth or billiotnths of the smallest time frame your brain can proceess. These aren't effects noticable to humans. It's really no different than a traffic jam in a highway. Just because one guy has to slam on the breaks to slow down for something doesn't mean the entire highway will instantly slow to his speed. There's a human reaction time and breaking time and this will propogate backwards as some speed until all the cars behind him slow down. Replace electrons with cars and human reaction time with the speed of light, and you have the circuit. Is your teacher wrong about KCL? No, KCL can be made to hold at all times. What he's skipping over is another two electrical circuit components, capacitors and inductors. Capacitors store charge and let through a displacement current, so all this minute charge build up and seperation would be represented by capacitors. Even if you don't have an actual physical capacitors in your circuit, you resistors and wires have inherent capacitance and inductance and to properly model it would have the actual physical resistor replaced with an ideal resistor and an ideal capacitor. Why did he skip capacitance and the actual change process when you add a new resistor? Because you'd need advanced mathematics including calculus and imaginary numbers to deal with it. In addition to being not all that important or even noticable. Also, as I've stated these changes happen way to fast for a human eye to see. However, if we stuck an actual capacitor in the circuit, a one that can hold a lot more charge than a resistor can, you could actually see these changes happening on a human timescale."]}

{"prompt": "Why Do Wind Turbines Always Have 3 Blades?\nAn elaboration of the question: Wouldn't having more than 3 blades mean that you can catch more wind?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["I just learned this in class last week. The number of blades chosen is a function of the tip speed ratio, which is the velocity of the tip of the blade over the velocity of the wind. If you have a high tip speed ratio, you have a low number of blades. Tip speed ratio is actually chosen for design purposes to be usually about 5 to 7 (i didn't copy the graph down in lecture), and the chart says to use 3 for that range. Basically I guess it's because it's cheapest to produce and transport blades of that length versus how much power you'll get out of the turbine", "Adding more propellors increases weight and turbulence, and can actually make a wind turbine less efficient. Also, the object isn't to catch the most wind, it is to keep the turbine spinning within it optimal range. For a given amount of propellor length, fewer blades are usually better. One blade is obviously impractical because the propeller would be unbalanced. The jump from two to three doesn't lose a lot of efficiency, but it does save a lot of space, allow more shorter towers. More than three doesn't give you as good of a tradoff.", "Three blades is calculated to be the right number to catch the wind but also not too many such that they run into the turbulence of the last blade that passed through that space. Too many blades and they block air rather than catch it."]}
{"prompt": "Why do tires “go off” or get slower over the course of the race?\nAn elaboration of the question: Why do race tires degrade over the course of the race? I get that rubber is removed by friction of the track but shouldn’t the same rubber be exposed?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["New tires have smooth, consistent contact patches. As the race goes on, the tire is subject to extreme asymmetrical loads. This changes the contact patch shape and wears different areas of the tire more quickly. The tire also sees abrasion from the track surface or debris, and if the rubber exceeds ideal temperature the tire can bluster, which causes vibration and additional wear. Therefore, all of these causes lead to a significantly altered contact patch and increased wear. This hurts lap times.", "Race tires are made of somewhat uncured rubber and are VERY soft and sticky rubber, great for the best possible grip while racing. But that also means they have an extremely short life. The both wear out very quickly because they are such soft rubber against an abrasive surface and once they fully heat up the rubber itself starts to cure. One heat cycle and they are no longer fully soft, they have begun to cure to a harder rubber with far less traction."]}
{"prompt": "Why is there one standard for music and movie playback that multiple manufacturers use but not for video games.\nAn elaboration of the question: Example: Sony, Samsung, LG etc, all make VHS, DVD, BluRay players etc, that all play one standard of media, but Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo all have proprietary gaming consoles. Why hasn't gaming gone the way of other media consumption?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Actually they do. Both PS4 games and Xbox One games use Blu-Ray discs. The reason why you can't play a game for one console on the other however is twofold. First, the encoding done on the disks at the time they're burned which includes code that prevents \"unapproved\" disks from being used. This is why you can't just download a ripped version of a next-gen game and burn it to a blu-ray, then stick it in your console. Second, each console has a very strict list of hardware that is used to create the console. This line has gotten blurrier in recent years as consoles have gotten closer and closer to being basically just PCs with specifically tailored operating systems but the hardware limitations still exist. If you were to put a disc from one system into the other and it *were* capable of reading it, the code on the disc still wouldn't necessarily be compatible with the hardware in use by the system. To use a highly generalized example the code on the disc may be expecting a specific graphics processor that isn't used on a competing console. tl;dr - Code on the disk is tailored to the console it's used for, both for antipiracy measures and in order to get as much power as possible from the machine. The fact that this forces consumers to use a specific console for specific games is just a bonus as far as the console manufacturers are concerned."]}

The holes are there to offer room for the material to flex, avoiding the uncomfortable hardness you'd experience if the tires were solid- it fulfills the same purpose as the pressurized air inside a regular tire, as well as lowering weight.

{"prompt": "Why do guns that fire the same caliber of bullet have different muzzle velocities?\nAn elaboration of the question: I'm looking at the wikipedia for the M16 and the M4 carbine. They are both listed as firing 5.56 x 45mm cartridges. The muzzle velocity for the M16 is listed at 960 m/s. The muzzle velocity of the M4 is listed at 910 m/s. Is this a function of barrel length? Some other variable? My understanding was that the same cartridge would have the same amount of gunpowder, leading to the same amount of force propelling the bullet forward.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Bullets are accelerated by the expanding hot gasses behind the bullet. If your barrel is 3 inches long, the bullet leaves the barrel before all the gas is finished pushing on the bullet. If your barrel is 5 feet long, the gas pushes all it can and then the bullet slows down due to friction in the barrel. Somewhere in the middle is the perfect point where the expanding gas gives the bullet all the energy it can with the least energy lost to friction. The M16 has a longer barrel, giving the bullet more speed when it exits the barrel. The M4 is shorter and more maneuverable in tight spaces, but a little bit of power is lost when you shorten the barrel."]}

Is that true?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Leaving a faucet on a slow drip keeps pipes from bursting when they freeze, not to keep pipes from freezing. If you put a can of soda in the freezer, when the soda freezes, the can might burst because water expands when it freezes solid. If you open the can beforehand, there’s more room for the soda to expand out the opening, the rest of the can will stay intact. Opening a faucet, even a little, makes more room for the water inside your pipes.

A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors is happy and survives. 3. A live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies of overcrowding 4.

{"prompt": "SOAP versus REST for web development\nAn elaboration of the question: I've read that SOAP is like putting your letter(request) in an envelope to make it more secure, while REST is just sending is the letter(request) as is.

But what goes on in a SOAP api?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["> I've read that SOAP is like putting your letter(request) in an envelope to make it more secure, while REST is just sending is the letter(request) as is. This is complete nonsense. The difference has absolutely nothing to do with security. Neither SOAP nor REST have encryption as part of the protocol. Someone apparently heard that SOAP has something called an \"envelope\" and completely misunderstood what that means. SOAP has a very detailed (and complex) specification on the message format level, and it is completely based on XML. It doesn't actually need to use HTTP, anything that can deliver text messages and responses works. The important difference is that with SOAP, the messages themselves contain all the information. When used over HTTP, a SOAP web service will have a single URL, and you use it by making a POST request to that URL and sending an XML which says something like \"this is a GetOrderList request and here are its parameters\", and in response you will receive an XML with says \"this as a GetOrderList response, and here is the data\". The advantage is that you have these exact specifications that tell you how requests and responses look like, and they will always follow the same basic rules in every system that uses SOAP. The disadvantage is that the specification (and the XML itself) result in quite a lot of overhead and complexity even if you want to send very simple messages. It is *not* enjoyable to use. In contrast, REST does not really have a standard, it just tries to use the elements of the HTTP standard (URLs, different HTTP methods, some of them previously almost forgotten) directly as part of the \"web service\" concept, the way you described it. This means that it is not really possible to use REST via anything but HTTP. The *format* of REST messages is actually not specified at all, it is typically JSON, but can be XML or even something else. The advantage is that it's simpler and much more pleasant to program, but since there is no real standard, every REST API works a little different, there can be surprises hidden, and in fact many APIs that call themselves REST actually don't follow the basic REST concepts at all - anything where one URL is used for different kinds of requests based on the *content* of the message is not \"RESTful\"."]}

{"prompt": "How come a mechanical watch changes it’s time over a long period of time\nAn elaboration of the question: Found an old watch from a few years ago and it’s around 20 minutes behind what my current time is.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["For starters, if it's been running nonstop since \"a few years ago\", I doubt it's actually a mechanical watch. A mechanical watch, one driven by a wound up spring and gears, can only run for a few days without needing to be wound. It's far more likely that you have some sort of quartz watch - where a battery run electricity through a crystal and count the vibrations - that simply has an analog face (ie - moving hands instead of an LCD display). Quartz watches can run for years on a single battery without a problem - smart ones can even stop moving the hands to save power & just slide them back to where they belong once motion is detected. That out of the way... Watches and clocks all do one simple thing internally: they make something happen periodically and count how many times it happens. A grandfather clock tracks swings of a pendulum, a mechanical watch tracks the oscillations of a spring loaded weight & quartz movements run electricity through a quartz crystal, causing it to vibrate and they count those vibrations. If the speed of that periodic thing isn't precisely tuned, the timepiece might run slightly fast or slow. Being off by only 20 minutes in a year means that it's 99.996% accurate - if it's been multiple years, that's even more accurate. One source I found online says that typical mechanical watches are typically only accurate to within 10 seconds per day & quartz watches are generally within about 15s per month. If you want to spend more money, you can get more accuracy - as little as 5s per year - but even a $100-150 watch can do 15s/year (as long as you prioritize accuracy over flashiness). All of that pales in comparison to sensitive scientific instruments. Atomic clocks can *easily* be accurate to within a second every million years. The current record is [accurate to 1 second every 15 billion years]( URL_0 ).", "It's essentially impossible to create a mechanical watch that counts time completely accurately, especially given that the internal mechanism changes its timekeeping based on the temperature and other environmental factors. The best mechanical watches typically keep time to within a second per day, which is only an error of about 0.001%, but can easily build up to being off by many minutes if you let them run for long enough."]}

The blue valves open and let in fuel, then close. The piston goes up which compresses the fuel until a spark ignites it. This creates an explosion which pushes the piston back down.

All of the pistons are connected by a shaft in the middle, but are staggered so one or more pistons going down helps push the other pistons up, repeating the process.

I'm not covering direct injection here. 2) compression, the piston moves up and compresses the air and fuel mixture. 3) detonate and expansion, a spark is generated which lights the fuel and air mixture. The heat generated expands the gases in the chamber creating power by pushing the piston down. 4) exhaust, the piston returns up pressing exhaust gases out the exhaust port and then starts back at the intake. Up and down motion is converted to rotary motion via the crankshaft. Valves for intake and exhaust are controlled by camshafts to ensure consistent timing of the opening and closing."]}
{"prompt": "Why do some engines have a much lower redline?\nAn elaboration of the question: What determines how high an engine can rev?

The more mass that has to be moved further gives a lower red line. I have a 8.3L V10 in my car. The redline is at 6k. The pistons are large and they move quite a long distance. By the time you make it to 6k it sounds like the gates of hell have opened up. Smaller engines like my motorcycle can rev up to 17k or more. They are smaller with little stroke movement. The valve train moves very little also. With that combination it can move much faster without parts breaking. Mass in motion. The more mass the less motion. Parts can only withstand a certain amount of stress before breaking.", "It's important to understand, the goal of burning fuel is to produce hot expansive gasses; the consequential pressure pushes on a piston as it tries to find equilibrium. This action is called force, and when it's transformed from linear motion to rotational motion, it's thus called torque - torque is force about an axis. Gasoline engines have a fixed charge of fuel and air that enters a cylinder and is burned, whereas a modern diesel has an initial mix of fuel and air entered into the cylinder, which is ignited by the heat of compression, and then subsequent injections of fuel are introduced during combustion. As a consequence, gasoline engines only produce torque for a fraction of the power stroke, and diesel engines produce torque for the entire power stroke. No diesel engine will run higher than ~5k rpm because diesel fuel *doesn't burn fast enough*. If you ran the engine faster, which is certainly possible, you'll be dumping still burning, still hot and expanding gasses out the exhaust manifold. I'd be a flame throwing explosion past the valve and down the manifold. Diesel engines, then are designed around the advantages of energy density and stability of the fuel and the speed at which it burns. Gasoline burns very fast and is very volatile. Gasoline used to be a waste product before the invention of the internal combustion engine because it was too evaporative and explody. F1 race cars engines are are speed limited by rules, because it was, like, 2008 Ferrari had a 22k rpm engine and they were working on a 25k one. None of the competition had the money or resources to compete, hence the 18-some-k rpm limit. That's how fast gasoline burns. And F1 cars run off (highly refined, if not pure octane) gasoline. Here, the limiting factor is not the fuel, but the mass of the engine components. I think they're running 1.6 L v6 engines, normally aspirated (vacuum pressure sucks charge into the cylinder when the piston strokes down on the intake stroke), and they're still making +700 hp, which is a measure of work. What is work? Think of it this way, if you want to move across a room in half the time, you need to perform twice the work, you don't need twice the force. How do they do that, when my sports car 3.5 L v6 makes 300 hp? If you want to make 700 hp, you need to breathe 700 hp worth of air. These engines are over-square, which means the pistons are wider than the length of their stroke. They move up and down less than an inch. The pistons and rods are made of aluminum, or titanium, or I've heard of connecting rods now made with some sort of carbon fiber type material. All in the name of reducing weight. My sports car engine's pistons at 7.5k rpm are moving the same top speed at the half way point down the cylinder as an F1 engine, but mine has several inches to speed up and slow down, and the rate it has to stop and change directions is much lower. The F1 engine has to stop and change directions more often in the same period of time, at 18k rpm, and less than an inch to do it. The connecting rod actually stretches and compresses, I think up to 1/2\" in some cases. If their components were made from the same shit as my sports car, the engine would explode from the weight alone. Can gasoline burn faster? Yes, but at this point it's a materials problem. Understand that high speed engines are a means to an end. F1 started building fast engines only because the league banned turbochargers in the 80s. If they had that option, these engines would run much slower, because there are more efficient ways of making power. Also be aware that these engines are at the fringes of what's physically possible. F1 regulation requires an engine to last 2 races. They had to impose that because the top teams were pushing their engines so hard they only lasted one race, and smaller teams couldn't compete. This is why street cars don't run stupid fast engines, because the fuel required to do so is expensive as hell, and the maintenance requirements are unsustainable."]}

The right way to check a light is every light needs to be wired individually, then power tested (it needs to use a well known amount of power), this requires electronically switching the light onto the power testing circuit. The circuit doing this needs to be able to actually power the light for test, so it can't be just the 1 cent circuits, it's going to be a rather substantial circuit, and it needs to interface with all the switches.

Sometimes when working with systems you *do* use that kind of calculation, in a black-boxish kind of way, usually to figure out what a source or load 'looks like' to the other parts of the system. Like: if a transistor output is leading into a current-hungry circuit, the intrinsic resistance in the transistor will cause the output voltage to drop (as Ohm's law says it will)... so you might add an emitter follower (aka common collector amplifier) stage that has a large input impedance (high 'resistance') that won't load down the previous circuit and a small output impedance (low 'resistance') that can drive the 'hungry' circuit without sagging... it's basically the opposite of a resistor.

The engine is using gasoline or diesel and making fire. It has alot of heat. It uses a water system to keep it cool. Some of the heated water is piped into a heat exchanger and fans blow out hot air. Most of the heat goes out on the cars exterior radiator. Cold air is made by an air conditioner. Compressed refrigerant is cold and absorbs heat, and evaporates into a gas, pumped outside, then compressed back into a liquid."]}
{"prompt": "How does a nuclear bomb explode before hitting the ground ?\nAn elaboration of the question: I always thought that a bomb was meant to explode when hitting the ground\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Bombs are made for different purposes, those which explode on impact are designed to destroy what they actually hit, whilst those that explode in the air cause damage to a wider area. Nuclear bombs are an area effect weapon so they work best when detonated at altitude this can be triggered in a number of different ways one of which is using the difference in pressure at different heights.", "While some bombs are crude enough to rely on simple kinetic energy (slamming into the ground) to ignite, many — including nuclear bombs — are not set up that way and require a fuze. A fuze is just a little device that triggers the detonation. For a ground burst, a fuze might be a little button that gets pushed, which would set off a tiny explosion, that would set off the larger, main explosion. For an airburst, there are different kinds of fuzes that can be used either individually or together to make sure the bomb goes off at the right height. All of this applies to conventional as well as nuclear weapons, though with nuclear weapons it is especially important to have good fuzing because they will not typically explode in a nuclear fashion if they just slam into the ground without a fuze (they are complicated devices that require precise timing to work) Examples of aerial fuzing might include: * A timer that activates when the bomb leaves the plane or whatever. This is a very crude method but if you know it will take 45 seconds to fall to the right height, you can just time it. * A device that uses barometric pressure to detect how far up or down it is. The precision on this kind of thing can be tricky, but they have been used. * A device that serves essentially as a little radar antenna to detect where the ground is, by bouncing radio signals off of it. And so on. In the first atomic bombs, all three of these were used in a sequence to make sure that the bombs were more or less at the right altitude before they exploded (the timer made such the bomb was outside of the plane, the barometric switch made sure it was below a certain altitude, and the radar antenna did the final check). You could even use GPS for this sort of thing, though there are errors that might be added. Depending on the nature of the target you are trying to hit, there are pros and cons for setting the bomb off in the air or on the ground. Generally speaking if you are trying to hit something relatively small and \"hard\" — like, say, an underground bunker or silo, or a single building, even a large one, like the Pentagon — you want your bomb to go off as close to the target as possible, because it concentrates the most pressure on it. If you are trying to hit something relatively large and \"soft\" — like, say, a city — you want your bomb to go off in the air, because it disperses medium and light pressures over a larger area (for a variety of reasons). It is just a small note that for many years the nuclear weapons of the USA could _only_ be used as airbursts because it is actually much harder to make a heavy, complex, delicate instrument that goes off at exactly the moment it hits the ground (and before the collision breaks it) than it is to make one that detonates several hundred feed above the ground.", "i believe he is asking \"how\" in terms of how the process flows so the device always explodes before hitting the ground rather than \"why\" we let them explode above ground", "Blowing up a bomb in the air has a different effect than one hitting the ground, or even below the ground. An explosion in the air covers a much wider area instead of directing energy down into the ground. Of course, if your target is a subterranean bunker, then they have ground penetrating bombs to take are of that.", "They have their own trigger mechanisms so impact with the ground doesn't have to be the trigger. They explode before they hit the ground because people either remote detonate them or set a timer that makes sure they go off that way (*why* air detonations are used has been explained by other users a bit). Separately, for a nuke to work a *very* precise series of firing mechanisms has to take place. The explosion has to start in a very specific, controlled way. If you just hit a nuclear bomb with another non-nuclear bomb to blow it up, it wouldn't go nuclear. It's not as simple as \"hit something and the reaction goes nuclear.\""]}
{"prompt": "What is a monolithic structure in operating systems?\nAn elaboration of the question: Follow up question, what kind of structure do the most popular OS use? Windows - ? MacOS - ? Linux - ? Android - ? iOS - ?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["In software, a monolith is a single program which performs a large number of tasks, but is still a single binary. The alternative to a monolith is to break the large program up into several smaller programs, each of which has a more narrow list of responsibilities. The alternative to a monolith is called (especially if you like buzzwords) something like \"Service Oriented Architecture\" or \"Microservices\". Monolith: One big program which performs a number of tasks Microservices: Many little programs, each of which only does one thing Operating systems are just programs, although they have a very specific set of responsibilities and are treated specially by the system. Some of these responsibilities are things like memory management, process management, thread management, disk management, device drivers, event handling and routing, I/O processing, interrupt processing, security and access, etc. Despite the fact that something like \"Process management\" is a pretty different beast from \"I/O processing\", these two things are still compiled into a single Kernel binary. In a monolith, if you need to update one of these, you have to update the whole shebang. This is a monolith. The alternative to a monolith would be to break all the different responsibilities into their own binaries, and those would communicate over some kind of messaging channel. This is called a \"Microkernel\" approach. Microkernel seems nice because each individual service can be smaller, simpler, and able to be managed/updated independently. The problem comes because the messaging channel which allows these services to communicate starts to become very complicated: handling enough bandwidth, keeping messages properly ordered, serializing and deserializing, keeping message contract versions in sync between services, etc. And then there are all the complexities where you have to keep track of which order the services are initialized in during boot-up, and all the million possible scenarios of what the system should do if one of the services crashes while the other ones are still healthy, etc. Linux, BSD and Android are pure monoliths. Windows basically uses \"hybrid\" approach with three basic parts: HAL, \"the microkernel\" and \"the executive\", where \"the microkernel\" is basically a normal monolithic kernel, and \"the executive\" contains several services which operate in kernel mode. Darwin (iOS, OSX) also uses a hybrid approach, though it's harder to describe. There's a kernel called \"Mach\", but there are components borrowed from FreeBSD like I/O and POSIX, and there are also a number of microkernel-like services though many of them run in user-space to avoid context-switches. The only \"real\" microkernel system I can think of for modern OS's is GNU Hurd, which has been under development for nearly 30 years and STILL isn't ready for reliable wide-spread use because of the inherent complexities of the approach. Symbian was a microkernel, but a lot of complexity there disappeared because symbian ran on single-core phones, and Symbian isn't really a thing anymore with the advent of iOS and Android.", "A monolithic structure means the kernel (all OS's have them) are set up so that the kernel does everything. This was the way it was first done in Linux - back when you had to compile your own kernel if you wanted support for sound (for example). As kernels got more sophisticated, they became too large to go with the \"one size fits all\" things, so they evolved to use modules, that could be added in whenever needed, and to accomodate more complex and sophisticated hardware. Nowadays, I don't know what Windows uses, but as for MacOS, I'm pretty sure they use a monolithic kernel, since the hardware is pretty narrowly defined. Linux used modules, but I'm not sure about Android or iOS. Soneone else could give a better better idea about these things. Hope this helps."]}

It's actually the cable that connects the anchor to the boat which keeps the boat or other sea vessel stationary. The cable uses the movement of the water to form a natural catenary. The catenary is the curve of a cable. This occurs because the cable is fixed to the boat and the ground so the weight of the cable causes the catenary. This curve of the cable absorbs the sudden movements of the water, such as waves, and allows the vessel to remain in place. & nbsp; Now, the catenary only works properly if it is safely secured at both ends. This is where the anchor comes into play. There are various types of anchors that are used. It all depends on the material that makes up the sea bottom. Some areas are extremely rocky and require a different anchor than if it were a soft sand. Their shapes are all different. For example, the [Mushroom Anchor]( URL_0 :) is used in a soft sea bottom for vessels that are going to be there awhile. It is designed so that it goes straight into the sea bottom and uses suction to remain. This is for more permanent mooring. The more traditional [Fisherman's Anchor]( URL_1 :) is designed so that the two flukes (points) can dig into a soft sand bottom."]}

None of this is good.", "Guns are made up of a bunch of metal pieces that need to slide around each other fairly closely. If pieces heat up at different rates, they'll expand differently and may have trouble sliding around in the right way. Inside a bullet is a tiny explosion that gets directed down a tube.

Many (not all) fully automatic firearms work using a direct impingement or similar gas-powered mechanism for pushing the bolt back, ejecting a the spent case, and loading a new round. Generally, this is the mechanism that fails in an automatic rifle. Basically how it works is there is a \"block\" near the end of the barrel that directs some of the gasses created by the ignited gunpowder up and into a tube that directs it back to cycle the bolt. Normally either the block will get so hot it \"melts\" or deforms and stops directing the gas the right way. Or the gas tube can do the same thing. Now, there's another mechanism. Good old fashioned blowback. It uses the gasses created by the gunpowder as well- but instead of traveling down a tube from the end of the barrel, it's designed so the bolt is quite literally blown back by the expanding gas in the actual chamber. So for this design, everyone else has already explained it. Usually a barrel can \"droop\" from getting so hot the metal is malleable, or other miscellaneous parts can be malformed or break from getting hot.

SCATS is based on the automatic plan selection from a library in response to the data derived from loop detectors or other road traffic sensors. SCATS uses sensors at each traffic signal to detect vehicle presence in each lane and pedestrians waiting to cross at the local site. The vehicle sensors are generally inductiveloops installed within the road pavement. The pedestrian sensors are usually push buttons. Various other types of sensors can be used for vehicle presence detection, provided that a similar and consistent output is achieved. Information collected from the vehicle sensors allows SCATS to calculate and adapt the timing of traffic signals in the network. SCATS is installed at about 42,000 intersections in over 154 cities in 25 countries.

{"prompt": "How does military camouflage work?\nAn elaboration of the question: How does it allow for snipers to be invisible. Or how does it allow hunters to be invisible while hunting deer?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Camouflage patterns don't actually make you invisible, it just makes it harder for someone to spot you. My 7th grade bio teacher had a great demonstration to explain camouflage in nature, you can try it yourself if you have different colored construction paper. Everyone gathered around their black table/desk top. Scattered around the surface were tiny squares of paper cut up, all a variety of colors. Red, blue, black, white, yellow, purple, etc. All the students were told to pick up as many of the squares as they could in 30 seconds, but you could only pick up one square at a time and then put it into a cup. By the end of the thirty seconds, there were almost as many black squares as there were when we started, a lot of dark purple squares, and almost no white or yellow squares, because the darker colors matched the black table top. That's how camouflage works (and how natural selection gives lots of animals natural camouflage). The reason for this is that eyes are very good at spotting changes, things that are different from the world around it, but are more likely to skim over things that are blending in with their background, like black paper on a black table or camouflaged snipers in the bushes. Military camouflage has similar colors to the leaves/dirt of the territory the wearer is working in, and it's arranged in round-ish blotches because it more closely matches the patterns of the leaves around the wearer. Because the clothes (and sometimes face paint) blends in with the area, it's much easier for someone looking in the direction of a sniper or hunter to miss them entirely, their eyes passing over the clothes without seeing a change from the environment. tl;dr: Eyes are good at noticing change, and when camouflage matches the area around it, it blends in, so eyes are more likely to skim over it and not notice.", "Mostly it works to disturb the human outline.

{"prompt": "why is it bad for planes to have a full tank of fuel?\nAn elaboration of the question: My pilot tonight held us up by an hour on the tarmac waiting for the fuel crew to pump out excess fuel. The fuel crew never showed up so the pilot announced we’re going to fly at a lower altitude to burn 1,700 lbs of fuel. Why would the pilot do that? Isn’t it a waste and harmful to the environment?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Aircraft have different maximum take-off weight and maximum landing weight. The forces on a aircraft is higher when you land compared to when you take off. It is quite obvious when you are take a flight. A takeoff are smooth but there is/can be a significant bump when you hit the ground and land. For a Airbus A 380 the maximum take-off weight is 575t and the maximum landing weight is 394t or 68% of the take off weight. and it can load 323,545 L ~300 t of fuel so a significant part of the withe of the plane when fully loaded is fuel In normal operation this is not a problem because the plane used fuel during its flight and you have the minimum amount of fule that you need to travel to the destination + a bit extra for diversions or other emergency. The result is that the plane when landing on a normal flight is as light as possible. You what to minimize weight because that will reduce fule usage. So if a aircraft have to do a unscheduled landing for a emergency it might need to dump fuel into the air so it can land in a safe way. I would guess that the aircraft you was incorrectly fule a mistake or fueled for a different destination that changed. So the alternative was to pump it out or fly in a less fuel efficient way so the weight of the plane is below the maximum landing weight when you land at the destination", "Was it a short flight? Maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) is higher than maximum landing weight (MLW). On a long flight, the plane will always burn enough fuel to be below MLW, even if it starts with a maximum fuel load. On a short flight, that isn’t always true. Say you have a plane going from NYC to London. It’s fuelled to near capacity. Some issue arises shortly after takeoff that means that the plane cannot continue across the Atlantic Ocean. If the issue is urgent enough, you can land right away, above MLW. But the plane will have to be thoroughly inspected as it may be damaged. If you can stay in the air and dump fuel or just circle to burn it (some planes don’t have dump valves) till the plane crosses under the MLW threshold, that is preferable. What I am speculating happened with your flight is that it was a short one and was overfuelled. With a normal course, the plane would arrive at its destination over the MLW and that is no good. Dumping fuel is an emergency measure, worse for the environment than burning it, and not possible on all planes. So instead the pilot purposefully flies a less efficient (lower) route so that more fuel is burned in flight and by the time it arrives at the destination airport, it is light enough to land without risking structural damage. You probably also made better time than scheduled. Cruise speed is a balance of fuel burnt and time spent. If you have to waste fuel, you might as well use it to go as fast as possible.", "Fuel is heavy. Commercial planes can have higher maximum take-of weights than their maximum landing weights. Your plane can weigh a lot more when it starts then when it lands. This usually makes sense because you burn fuel and it gets lighter during the flight. However when you need to land before you thought you would or started with more fuel than needed for some reason you have a problem. Normally it makes sense to fly with as little fuel as needed because fuel is expensive and even just carry around fuel that you don't use ends up wasting fuel to transport the extra mass. In an emergency situation there is also the added consideration that you don't want to crash with giant tin can fuel of highly flammable fuel."]}

It's made of sand grains and water that bonds them together. Now build same looking castle with same sand grains and water but 10 times bigger. You will notice that walls start to break easily. This is because much stronger forces (sand weight) affect your construction but you still use water of same bonding power. Lets try use glue instead of water and your construction will be much stronger. Let's go to different scale. Sand grains become atoms and water/glue becomes chemical bonding. Many material properties like durability or elasticity change with scale because forces goes up or down but bonding stays the same.

{"prompt": "Digital Aliasing and the Nyquist Frequency\nAn elaboration of the question: What is aliasing? What are some examples? What is the nyquist frequency in relation to aliasing?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The real world is analog, things like sound and radio are continuous oscillations. While quantum field theory is true, most all real-life things are much, much too large to have discrete quantum behavior. When you sample something digitally, you are making a discrete measurement at a specific time and using that to represent the continuous signal. This is never correct, the real world is analog, but it's often plenty good enough. The Nyquist Frequency is all about knowing when it's good enough. Let's say you sample at 1000 samples per second. If the signal is 60 cycles/second, like wall electricity, you have each sine wave represented with 16-ish values. That's 8 for the positive side of the wave and 8 for the negative side. That will produce a very good representation. At 250 cycles per second, you're down to 2 for the positive side and 2 for the negative side. This could be 0, 1, 0, -1, ... which looks a lot more like triangles than a sine wave; or it could be .6, .6, -.6, -.6, ... which looks wrong in a different way. At 500 cycles/second, you've got 1, -1, ... or 0, 0, ...; barely right at all. At 2000 cycles/sec, you get .6, .6, .6, .6, ... or -.3, -.3, -.3, ... Absolutely wrong. And 4000 cycles/sec is exactly the same wrong. These are \"aliases\" of each other. The Nyquist frequency is last frequency where you barely get the right shape.

{"prompt": "What is the science behind overclocking a CPU?\nAn elaboration of the question: What actually happens behind the scenes, inside the computer for it to overclock? Edit: Went to sleep and came back to crap ton of answers. I appreciate it truly and will read each one. Thanks!\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Imagine 500 workers in your company. Each worker fills out a form, their work. You give them 10 minutes for one form, since some guy has calculated that to be the best \"base clock speed\" of 3000 forms per hour. You actually sell your company to other people and they perform as advertised, but every company you sell has DIFFERENT workers (obviously). It is still kind of the same company though. It turns out, your workers fill out the form in 8 minutes on average and then meet in the hallway to chat. One of your customers thinks he can 'overclock' his company: he tells all the workers they only have 9 minutes to fill out the form. Works great, there were still resources left in that company and now you have a company that gives 3300 forms per hour (10% increase). One of the customers friends got wind of the overclocking and tries it with his company. It's horrible: the workers take 9 minutes on average to fill out a form, so on average they should meet the 9 minute requirement, but they have no more time to chat, get depression and burnout. Eventually a worker quits because he had enough. This is where your company becomes unstable and locks up, e.g. the overclocking went too far, not enough untapped resources were available, mistakes are made that cannot be undone, etc. The 'potential' for overclocking is different for each model and even differs with each CPU sold. If you increase the clock speed, some signals can get lost in transit if the physical layout of your CPU is 'bad' (this means that one of the circuit paths during the lithography process was less than ideal, too thick or too thin for example) so you also need to increase voltage, but THAT in turn increases temperature and also, since each circuit path is an antenna, the influence one circuit path can have on another. This can go to a point where to circuits cancel out each other's signals when they 'transmit radio signals' too much. That 'interference' is what cannot be overcome by any means other than designing the CPU differently. In essence, there's potential to do stuff faster. How MUCH is determined by the quality if the design AND the individual 'print' of your CPU. To get your CPU to a stable processing speed that is higher than what the manufacturer intended is tricky but can usually be done reliably without damaging the component by 1. increasing the frequency until failure 2. increase voltage to strengthen signal 3. repeat 1+2 until failure because of interference The reason a manufacturer picks a certain clock speed is simple: yield. One printed wafer gives a certain percentage of functional dies (the heart of your CPU). Each die is tested to run at the base clock speed. The better the design and the better the manufacturing process as well as how carefully chosen the clock speed is: more dies per wafer = more cash. The idea is to get the best die per wafer that can reliably be produced with as few losses as possible.", "Nothing is perfect, but some parts of the processor chip are better than others. The chip company, on the other hand, wants to have about 3 speeds of parts for sale. They test all the parts, to see how fast they can run without making mistakes. The parts that work best get the high speed rating, the middle parts get the middle rating, etc. You, on the other hand, only have one part in your computer. You can choose to provide better cooling than the chip manufacturer requires. As a result, you can choose to slightly increase the speed of your CPU to make a faster computer. It's a bit of work, and it gives you a non-standard configuration, but it might be worth it.", "Processor manufacturers practice boxing. They have one assembly line that makes all their CPUs of some kind. Then they test them. You see, manufacturing at the atomic scale isn't a perfected process, so lots of flaws make it in. If your CPU has 4 cores and one is dead, disable it and sell it as a 3 core CPU. This is why Intel has such variation in their product offering. The CPU you're running is discounted because it's mostly broken. The CPUs that make it through manufacturing fully functional are the top end offering and the most expensive. Among this testing process, they see how fast a CPU can change state, because there are some trillion-plus transistors that all have to switch at the same time, and your CPU can only go as fast as the slowest one. All this is ostensibly true. If their process improves and they make more fully functional CPUs, they may hamper the device intentionally, so they have commodity offerings and they can capture that segment of the market, lest they go to a competitor for a CPU in their price range. So all this is locked in to a CPU by physically breaking connections. Unlocking the CPU means reestablishing these connections that enable, at the very least, higher clock rates. The improved performance comes with a risk of reduced reliability and stability. It also means the device will run hotter, because faster switching speeds are accompanied with additional power consumption. There are overclocking motherboards, but they increase the bus speed, which is the speed your memory is running at, which is much lower than your CPU speed. This can give a good boost in performance because your CPU spends most of it's entire life idling, waiting for data to arrive from memory. This also comes with increased power consumption, and heat, and reduced stability and reliability. System memory, RAM, is made from banks of tiny capacitors which hold a tiny charge, and writing data to one requires either charging or discharging it. This takes time. If you run the bus speed too fast, then this transition can't happen fast enough, and you end up with memory corruption, false 0s and 1s."]}
{"prompt": "why is the tail wheel on an airplane usually tiny?\nAn elaboration of the question: It seems like it wouldn't be robust enough to handle much weight.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["There’s not much weight on the rear of those aircraft so the smaller wheel works fine. The smaller wheel also saves weight.", "The center of gravity is almost over the front wheels, so there is very little weight on it. You can easily lift the tail of a single engine aircraft with one hand. You do not want a tail heavy plane (a front heavy plane flies badly, a tail heavy plane flies once). Also, you don't want anything heavy in the tail. 1 kg in the tails means you need 5 kg in the front to balance it, due to the leverage of the long tail. If you look at a taildragger landing or taking off, you'll also notice that the tail is only on the ground at low speeds. As soon as it gets some speed, the tail lifts and the plane becomes horizontal. That said, for these reasons and a few more, taildraggers are being phased out. They remain in some applications (aerobatics (weight), bush flying (robustness), glider towing (works better with the towing forces) and a few more), but most new aircraft use a nose wheel. They are less likely to \"nose-over\", and the pilot has a better field of view during taxi (if you look at old warbirds, which have a huge engine, you often see them zig-zag during taxi, because the pilot can't see straight ahead)."]}

Not only am I asking about their function, but why use gemstones instead of something like precision-engineered titanium or other hard-and-light materials?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["One reason is that they are very hard, and this means they take a LONG time to wear out, but that's already been said. The other reason is friction. Since they are so hard, they can be polished into an extremely smooth surface. When used as bearings in a watch, this translates into very low friction. This accomplishes two essential goals is watch design. It minimizes energy loss due to friction, allowing the watch to run longer between windings. It also makes the movement much more consistent, translating to better accuracy.", "Because some gems like sapphire are really resistant to abrasion. So you can use those as bearings that don't wear as much as a metal bearing. But eventually its market.

In an AC line, the electrons move less than 1 meter before the current reverses direction. But *all the electrons throughout the wire* move back and forth together, like a mob in a very crowded room.", "The electrons don't, current does. Think of hose filled with water, the water is the electrons, but when you turn the water on it instantly flows out the other end, the water didn't instantly travel the full length of the hose, but the pressure did, and it pushed the water at the other end out. You could have two hose and alternate what one is one and what one is off to get the water to flow back and forth from one hose to the other and back. The water would move back and forth, and work can be extracted from the flow. But in that case the water is just moving back and forth a few inches at the time, and isn't moving in any particular direction over the long term. That's what AC power is like, the electrons are moving back and forth a very small distance, and not going anywhere, but the fact that they are moving is enough to extract power from it."]}

All the pixels that aren't in the right place or don't work are not sold to customers. (Actually, most displays are allowed to have 3-6 failed pixels.)

A 3 GHz processor, like an average desktop computer, can theoretically make as many as 3,000,000,000 calculations every second. That's more than enough to draw 2,073,600 pixels 30 time a second. (1080x1920 resolution at 30 frames per second.) This is further aided by having a graphics card, which contains its own processor that's optimized for drawing things on the screen. The CPU (brain of your computer) can delegate the graphics portion of a program to the graphics processor, (GPU) and focus on other processes in the program. As for mistakes, they happen all the time, you just don't notice them very much, as any given frame is gone within 1/30th or less of a second. You you've had graphical glitches in games or even just stuttering frames on you screen, you've seen a time where the program running might just be too much for the hardware to handle. Edit: if you're asking about the manufacturing side of things, remember that each pixel isn't a distinct light, but an adjustable filter made out of liquid crystals with a backlight of LED's behind them.

(This explaining the question!)\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Electrical boxes are made out of metal *because* metal is conductive! The metal of the box is grounded/earthed so that if it's touched by a live wire, the electricity will be safely redirected away from anything that could be harmed by it (blowing a fuse or tripping a breaker in the process). A plastic electrical box could melt and catch fire when exposed to a large electrical current.", "The box is *supposed to be* tied to ground so that if there is a miswire and something touches the box then it will short to ground and trip the breaker, cutting the power and making everything safe again. The wires in the box should be properly insulated as well, this keeps them from touching things they aren't supposed to and keeps the electricity only in the wires that it is supposed to be in.

{"prompt": "What happens when a generator is running but no load is being applied?\nAn elaboration of the question: For example; a portable gas powered generator. When the generator is running it is capable of powering a fridge. What happens when the same generator is running but no load is applied? Is electricity still being made?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["> Is electricity still being made? Yes. There's voltage, but no current. Static electricity is a different example of accumulation of potential without a load. Voltage is sometimes called \"potential\" because it *could* make current flow if a load is connected. Since no load is connected, no current is flowing and no electric *power* is generated. Power is voltage times current.", "Short answer: with no load generator is easier to turn. It gets more difficult to turn (and takes more energy) as the load increases. essentially it has to do with inductive reactance in the coils of the generator. in simple terms, a magnetic field moving near a conductor will induce an electric potential within that conductor. when the generator is spinning with no load you still have electromotive force (voltage) but no current flows and in an ideal generator no *power* is produced. P = VI (ohms law). The amount of torque required to spin the generator's rotor is proportional to the amount of load. the more load the more *work* to spin the rotor one revolution. The rotor will be \"easier\" to turn with no load. Its all physics. so you have basically an electromagnetic coil spinning inside of some other coils, and really a generator is not much different than an electric motor (in fact many types of AC motors will function as generators, producing a voltage when you spin them while *off*) current flowing through a coil of wire produces a magnetic field and the north pole will attract the south pole of another magnet. With alternating current the polarity reverses cyclicly so when the rotor poles gets close to the stator coils, the direction of current flow and thus the magnetic poles reverse so they dont just get close to each other and stick (3 phase AC is really useful here). If you spin the rotor and attach a load instead of a current source, a rotating magnetic field is produced, which induced an AC voltage in the coils. (the term AC voltage just made me wonder, alternating *current*, well thats just what its called i guess) The rest is a lot of physics, and math. Basically a lot of electrical engineering technical shit that hopefully somebody that knows more about it than me can explain in elegant simple terms that ur average person thats not an electrical engineer or can understand; I'm a computer science student but I dont know everything about electrical circuits (but wants to know everything there is to know about everything), especially when it's not digital logic.

{"prompt": "Where does water pressure come from?\nAn elaboration of the question: In municipal water supply, such as my faucets at my home, where does the water pressure originate. Or, what creates the pressure to allow it to flow to our homes?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["I'll just try to elaborate a bit. There are only 2 common ways to increase the pressure of any fluid (including water). Pressure is equal to the density of the liquid times the height, it doesn't matter how wide or deep the pipe is, the water pressure at the bottom of a 2 inch diameter tube that's 100 feet tall will be the same as a 2000 inch diameter tube that is 100 feet tall. So water is either collected at high elevation (rain collecting) or pumped to a higher elevation (tank at the top of a tower). Pumping is the second method to increase pressure, which is pretty obvious, using electrical power, to turn mechanical parts that apply force to the fluid to increase pressure."]}

The rest is technical.", "Because Sony makes a shittone of Bravia TVs and calling them all the same thing would lead to confusion. Look, per Sony's website there are 21 Bravia TVs and many of those models come in 3 or 4 sizes. So there's potentially 100 different Bravia TVs and that only includes this years models. They've been selling Bravia TVs since 2005 so there's likely thousands of combinations of features and sizes. It might be that the complex model numbers are confusing. In the case of Sony, they DO mean something it's just that the average consumer might not be aware of what they mean. Take your example: KD-55XD8505 KD notes that it's a Bravia TV, as opposed to a Sony camera or something. 55 is the size of the TV. X means it's an 4K Ultra HD screan. D notes the year, in this case D means 2016. 8505 notes the exact panel and features within that size and model year. Generally the nigher the number the more features it'll have. For the informed consumer, this tells them a lot of information about a TV. The average consumer need only know it's a Sony Bravia. This is opposed to Apple's strategy.

If you look at the fine print under it, it says \"model A1533\" I can look that up and know it's a 5s GSM model intended for the North American market. The A1453 is a CDMA intended for the US and Japan, A1457 is for the UK, Europe and the middle east, A1528 is for China and A1530 is for Asia Pacific.

{"prompt": "How can one rocket get over 100 satellites into each of their positions around the Earth?\nAn elaboration of the question: India just broke the record for how many satellites put into orbit with one rocket. Each one travels at immense speed so must be spread out a lot surely? So how can one rocket achieve this?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["I'll simplify and just consider two satellites. Their rocket launches them together into a certain orbit, and then the satellites split up and need to get far apart. They can use their own engines or one can get help by the launching rocket. It doesn't require much rocket fuel for one satellite to go ahead of the other. One satellite just has to drop its orbit a tiny bit and it will go faster and has a shorter path, so it will steadily pull ahead of the other one. It's a bit like a racing car taking the inside lane. Once the two satellites are far enough apart, they can get themselves back into matching orbits and they'll stay with one leading the other. It takes a bit more rocket fuel for one satellite to get into a higher orbit than the other. But not too much if you only need say a 50 or 100 km difference. And then the two satellites will be in different orbits and the closest they'll come to each other will be the difference in their orbital heights. But it takes a *lot* of rocket fuel if you want one satellite to tilt its orbit round so it's different to another. This is because the satellites are doing about 7 km per second already, so to deflect that speed north or south requires a big push. So while the multiple satellites launched by a rocket can orbit at different heights or get into different positions around their orbits, they must all stay in nearly the same plane. If you looked at the orbits of just those 100 satellites, it'd be a bit like the rings of Saturn."]}

There is an element of trial and error but for the most part creating new works is based off of previous experiences. As for recording the steps necessary to recreate a new origami design, most people work backwards from a finished work. It's much easier to deconstruct and record, since there will be some folds that were made in error."]}
{"prompt": "Why is it so hard to make smart-devices waterproof?\nAn elaboration of the question: It seems like you can currently get a cheap case for things like the iPhone 6 that make it water-proof. What's the hurdle that stops companies from making almost every device they put out waterproof?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Most small electronic devices have very fine instructions on how they're made so that they fit together and feel smooth all over. This is hard enough even when you're not thinking about people putting the device in water. If you want to worry about having the device be submerged, that's an extra layer of precision (and more expensive quality control) that has to go into how the parts fit together that form the outside, as well as things like polymer seals in the places where water could get in (like at the microphone, or between the lens of the camera and the shell). You could just put a special case all the way around a \"normal\" phone but this makes the device bigger and heavier. You also have to make some guesses as to how deep into water the device may go, because the forces involved in submersion are directly proportional to depth. Other guesses need to be made about the possibility of contaminants or solutions in the water that could get stuck or corrode your seals, like naturally occurring acids. There are other possible things to worry about, but it's all another layer of engineering that has to have its own quality control layer, which just increases the complexity of manufacturing. All, for something that most people think is something you should naturally avoid anyways. Of course it's becoming a competitive point for some products these days and the market is always changing. Who knows, maybe waterproofing will become a default option in the future."]}

It's that there's not a reason to have them on the same side. So each manufacturer dies what's best for their factory and design.", "Researching this I found a few candidate explanations: The filler cap is on the opposite side to the exhaust pipe. Makes sense that it would reduce the risk of igniting spilled fuel, and it might also be mechanically easier to build. As for which side the exhaust is on, that will be influenced by the engine mounting especially for a transverse engine. If there's a lever in the car on the driver's side to release the filler cap, putting the filler cap on the driver's side too is mechanically simpler. But my own car goes against this - UK model Suzuki, so right hand drive, lever on the floor just next to the driver's door, left hand side filler cap. Probably the car designers just put it where it's easiest, considering the rest of the vehicle. Things like which side the driver sits, a transverse-mounted engine, and certain rear lights all create asymmetries in car design."]}

When people say we don't know how they built the pyramids, it's more about us not knowing their exact methods, not about how they were so advanced and we could never do it today. We do have plenty of plausible theories but we can't say we know exactly for all of them. The amazement is about what they managed to achieve with what they had, not about us not being capable of replicating it at all. Also keep in mind the amount of time and effort that was put into some of these megastructures. They took many decades to build and were huge efforts that often took the resources of powerful kingdoms/states/empires. I'd say it's better to compare the building of the pyramids to something like the Space Race and moon landing rather than to buildings today. Also note that it's not as if these megastructures somehow prove that ancient peoples had better building technology. They would've found it impossible to build the skyscrapers we can put up in a few short years. The Roman ancient roads were an amazing achievement at the time, but they would not have found it possible to build the US highway system. And just because stone tablets will last hundreds of more years than paper doesn't mean that they are somehow more advanced to develop.", "We could probably build the Pyramids today if we had the motive. It would probably be cheaper than the border wall.", "I often hear amazement specifically for the size of stones used in ancient structures. As far as I know, the ancients haven't been surpassed in that regard. We could surpass them if we wanted to, but we have modern materials that are easier to build with. So, we don't surpass the massive stones, and we remain awed by the real achievements of engineering that used them. Similarly, entering a structure made all of wood with no nails can impress us for achievements that we do not emulate today. The examples abound of architectural practices that awe is that are out of vogue: gargoyles, stained glass, spires, even large scale brickwork is not seen so much and impresses me when I see the beautiful rows of bricks, and the devil's bridges, and the mud skyscrapers of Yemen, and so on.", "I've heard \"how did they get so many people to build that?\" on more than one occasion for an ancient structure that would've taken hundreds or even thousands to assemble.

Many of the marvels of ancient times--like the pyramids--were heavily built by ~~slave~~ conscripted labor. **some structures like the Colosseum used slave labor** With slavery now much less prominent, and considered by most modernized civilizations to be barbaric and cruel, we rely on the heavy work to be done with engineering and usually individuals on risk-pay (relatively high pay for unskilled labor based on very high risk of injury or death). Even very large tasks in the last couple centuries utilized a good amount of forced or slave labor until we developed machines to expedite the work. Like the Railroad system of the US. Don't know if that was what you were asking. Edit: pyramids were a bad example, as some pointed out they didn't use a lot of slaves, but conscripted labor. Added the Colosseum example, as everyone will know that, and slaves were definitely utilized.

{"prompt": "Why do German luxury automobile brands such as Audi/BMW/Mercedes recommend oil changes every 15K+ miles whereas American standard brands like Ford and Chevy still recommend oil changes every 3-5K miles?\nAn elaboration of the question: I have always owned American car brands and regularly changed the oil at the recommended 5K mile mark as part of the routine maintenance. I recently got a BMW X3 and found out that the recommended mileage before getting an oil change is around 15K. This lead me to ask: What is it about the design of the German vehicles that allow them to go longer without changing the oil? Does the engine run at a slightly temperature than American models? Does it have to do with the fact that I am combusting higher rated gasoline in it(requires premium)? Do they use a superior oil filter? If anyone could give some insight, I would greatly appreciate it because I was genuinely curious and don't know enough about cars to formulate my own hypothesis.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Service contracts. BMW used to recommend oil changes every 5000 miles or so, but then the marketing department got involved and offered free oil changes for the first X years, and once the dealers had to pay the cost of the service the interval magically tripled so you needed fewer of them. The effect is that with the reduced servicing the car will still run fine for the duration of the warranty, but at the end of the warranty period it'll have more wear and tear and may need to be replaced sooner - another win for the marketing department.", "It's mostly due to advances in petroleum engineering. German cars use full synthetic oil, usually 5w-40 or 0w-40 depending on the region you live. The first number measures the oil at very cold temperatures(0F). The second number measures the oils' performance at engine operating temperature (210F). This is important for oil life. Full synthetic oils last much, much longer than natural oils, since they have been specifically engineered to do so. Additionally by having a high heat tolerance -40 oils don't degrade due to heat as fast as lower rated oils. You could put full synthetic 0w-30 in an american car and go 10,000 miles between changes no problem. But I wouldn't recommend putting -40 in a car that wants -30, it might be a little too thick that what the engine was designed for.", "Check your owners manual. Many cars today don't go by the 3,000 mile thing anymore. The dealer will, but they sell oil changes so they want you in as often as possible.", "Here in Europe I had Ford, Peugeot, Citroen and Fiat.

Add full synthetic to the blend and essentially you have a huge oil storage capacity, thereby making your oil last longer and help your engine stay lubricated. BMW 6 cylinder engines are about 6.9 quarts as well. Whereas other domestic manufacturers seem to have less oil quantities for the comparable engine sizes. That's just what I've noticed, don't know if there's any truth to it. My oil changes on my 2015 Mini (which has a BMW motor) are 8,000 miles and I do oil changes every 4K because I drive hard on it and have a turbo motor."]}
{"prompt": "From an electrical engineering perspective, how does binary code actually work?\nAn elaboration of the question: How does the specific arrangement or combination of on and off switches physically translate into anything productive?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["On a physical level, it works via logic gates. The principle behind them is that they take one or two bits (which will be a wire with a current going through it or not) and output a single bit. Here are the main ones used for every possible mathematical operation: * **AND** -- Takes two bits and only output 1 if both input bits are 1 * **OR** -- Takes two bits and only outputs 1 if one or both input bits are 1 * **NOT** -- Takes one bit and flips it. Output 1 if the input is 0, outputs 0 if the input is 1 * **XOR** -- Takes two bits and outputs 1 if either bit is one, but will output 0 if *both* bits are one. This gate isn't actually necessary, you can get the same result by combining the above gates. But that's the key, we can combine gates to get more complex operations. With these operations you can perform any mathematical operation on any number, which is the only thing computers ever do. How do the gates work? Well let's imagine that we put a resistor into a circuit. It won't allow a current to continue unless the input is twice the current of a single wire, so both wires feeding into it need to be active. This is an AND gate. On the other hand, if we just connected the two wires together with diodes to make sure the current goes to where we want it to, that's an OR gate. If we have a power source constantly powering a wire, but a breaker switch is activated when an input wire is powered, that's a NOT gate. The actual gates don't work like this on a CPU level, with diodes and breaker switches and such, but the electronic concepts are the same.", "It is, as you said, a series of switches. In the right combinations those switches form some basic logic circuits. The 3 basic ones are AND - this takes two inputs and if they are both 1 it outputs a 1, otherwise a zero (no voltage). Next is an OR gate. Again this takes 2 inputs but if either of them is 1 (high) it outputs a 1. If both are low its output is also low. Finally we have a NOT gate. This inverts the input. A 1 becomes 0 and 0 becomes 1. Now these can be grouped together into logic circuits that perform computationally interesting operations. String lots of logic blocks together and you have a processor. Now again all the processor does is take +ve and -ve signals on the input pins, passes these through the processor and the result (+ve and -ve) is presented on the ouput pins. From there, transistor amplifiers can take these signals and amplify them into things we can see or hear."]}

The voltage is extremely high and also the current. This results in the components and power stations need to be really robust and will be much more expensive. Anorther thing with electricity is that it's a fresh produce, and only produced for immidiate consumption. No power plant is producing more power than what is being consumed, that's because there's no effective way of storing energy.

{"prompt": "Object Oriented Programming Languages\nAn elaboration of the question: OOP VS procedural and why everyone says its such an important concept for me to understand; but then cant give a clear description of either or why? Thanks!\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["I actually had to explain this to my 5 year old. A procedural program is like a recipe. If you want to make a cake you take the recipe and do each step. Sometimes the steps refer to other recipes (like the icing); we call those \"methods\". And there are amounts of things you have (like cups of flour); we call those variables. Now let's say you were baking a 8 course meal. You'd have a ton of recipes (methods) and amounts of stuff (variables) to keep track of. Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of organizing the methods and variables to keep everything together. An object is a thing (a noun) and you attach variables (usually called properties) and methods (verbs). The object keeps all of that stuff together and makes sure that you don't mix up your cake recipe with another one. But one important takeaway is that these are not mutually exclusive. Most (but not all) OOP languages are procedural, and a lot (but not all) procedural languages offer OOP.", "Note that in the following examples, I'm using pretty standard OOP terminology, but things may vary by language. The basic idea of OOP is that you describe your program as a set of objects, each of which have their own data and behavior. For example, a game might have a Player object containing the data \"health\", \"speed\", and \"strength\", and containing the behaviors \"Move with keyboard input\", \"lose health (and possibly die)\", and \"drink health potion\". Now let's say we want to add AI players, or networked players. Suddenly we need our Player class to be more flexible! The \"Move with keyboard input\" behavior is no longer acceptable. One simple way to solve this is to make Player into something called a \"base\" class: replace \"Move with keyboard input\" with the more generic \"Move with some kind of input\", then create \"child classes\" called HumanPlayer, NetworkedPlayer, and AIPlayer that all handle their \"Move with some kind of input\" in different ways. This is known as \"inheritance\": defining child classes that act like a special version of the base, or \"parent\", class. Alongside inheritance is \"polymorphism\" and \"encapsulation\". Your game could store a list of \"Player\"s, each of which is one of the child Player types, and call each of their \"Move with some kind of input\" without caring which type each Player actually is! If you want a new networked player, just add a new NetworkedPlayer to the list -- the game doesn't care what kind of Player he is; it just runs his behaviors like it would with any other Player. In other words, the responsibility of handling all that player's networking code is \"encapsulated\" in the NetworkedPlayer class, so nobody else has to worry, care, or even *know* about it. This is the main advantage of OOP: a powerful way of grouping code so that other groups of code only have to care about the outward interface it exposes, not everything that might be going on underneath. Edit: typos", "For context, one of the reasons why explaining these concepts is difficult is that the last few generations of programmers did their entire computer science education within procedural and object-oriented paradigms. Both ideas came out of the [software crisis]( URL_0 ) in the 1960s where the complexity of software development projects was increasing too fast for engineers to keep up. Recent CS students and professionals (myself included) never worked in a world where these things were not the main way people did things. In a procedural programming language, a program consists of instructions describing actions the computer is to take. Pretty much every modern and popular programming language is procedural in some way, and your first CS teachers may have actually defined computer programs as \"instructions for the computer to follow.\" One alternative to procedural programming is functional programming where a program isn't so much a list of actions but a list of expressions that represent the type of data the program is supposed to produce. Lisp and SQL are examples of this model of programming. Object-oriented programming is primarily a method of code organization. Generally, you learn about data (variables) and procedures (functions) as separate things. OOP languages package related data and procedures together. The primary advantage of this is that how a piece of a software system *works* is separated/isolated from how it's *used* by the rest of the software system. This idea is called \"encapsulation\" and allows software teams to work separately on parts of a large project and then easily join them together.", "These are not really different things. Almost all languages are procedural. Procedural refers to procedures. You can think of your code as being one procedure, with maybe sub-procedures in it. Procedure being one set of instructions that your computer follows. Typical example is a recipe, that's a procedure of sorts. Your CPU, at its core, works like this, so most languages derive procedural nature of theirs from CPU. However, once you start building these complex procedures(think of 1,000 page long recipes with cross-references), you'll notice that it's actually darn difficult to safely change any section of the recipe and still have any sort of prediction about what is gonna happen next. If you change one sub-procedure(sub-recipe that may or may not be referenced from elsewhere), you're gonna have to go through all the 1,000 pages with care to make sure none of those pages suddenly stop making sense as a result of your one change. OOP is a proposed solution to this. It packs sub-procedures with the data they handle into Objects. This means when you make changes into some sub-procedure, you only have to check the pages dealing with this object. You can, by purposefully programming so that you refrain from referencing to data outside selected pages, do Object-Oriented Programming even with programming languages that are purely procedural with no Object-Oriented Programming support. OOP languages exist to help programming this way, packing data and procedures that handle that data together. But the big key thing here is that you will have limited access to all Data, which is managed by objects, so that if data is corrupt, that must be because of the limited number of functions that are allowed to handle that data."]}
{"prompt": "What effect does the curvature of the Earth have on really large buildings, roads and other infrastructure?\nAn elaboration of the question: If you had a really really large building would you have to take into account the Earth's spherical shape during design and construction?

But second of all, we know or can calculate the average curvature of the earth, so could curve it properly if need be. However, practically, I don't think it matters. The only common structure big enough to even worry about the curve (that I can think of) is transportation like highways or railroads, or the occasional bridge. They just build them on the ground*, which has been moved around as needed with heavy machinery to be within tolerances. You can make sure it's all true with good ol' Euclidean (flat) geometry. I know there's a lot more that goes into roads and railroads than literally \"put them on the ground\" but I'm not a civil engineer and that's not really within the scope of the question.", "With buildings, practically never. They don't cover enough land area that curvature needs to be taken into account, and their sites will be graded flat prior to construction which will eliminate any residual effect of curvature. Tunnels basically ignore it, short ones are just built straight and longer ones (such as the Channel Tunnel) curve to go through the best rock formations. It only really comes into play with really big bridges.

This is far, far less than natural local variations in terrain. Therefore it has no effect on people making buildings.", "Generally, they almost always don't. The variations are incredibly small. However, one (amusing) exception are some proposed towers in the UK: URL_0 They want to use them for high frequency trading with Europe. Turns out over that distance, the curvature does matter, because they want unobstructed line of sight (HFT is sensitive to even millisecond delays).

Most of the missions before Apollo 11 even just circled around the moon without landing, and I can't figure how they knew they would have to adapt to an environment that different from space. How did the engineers from NASA (and also soviet Russia, they must have thought about it too) knew what \"being\" on the moon would be like?

Think of it this way - if you are in the desert and see a small city in the distance - you might not know if it's small and close, or large and far away. So you move closer to it and make another measurement, and now you can determine whether it's small or far away.", "A lot of it can be calculated or observed. Just by knowing how big and heavy the Moon is it's easy to work out how much fuel and what kind of engine it takes to land. Observations by Earth-based telescopes and space probes gave us a good idea what the surface terrain was like. And there had been robotic landers such as Surveyor 3 sent before humans got anywhere near the Moon.

{"prompt": "What is fracking?\nAn elaboration of the question: I see a lot of controversy over fracking. In Europe, people are overwhelmingly against fracking. On Reddit, I see a lot of people who support this as a business opportunity. But in the end I don't really know what the fracking method is... I searched here but the answers were not really LI5. An extra question would be: is it safe/mastered today.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Fracking is short for \"hydraulic fracturing\". The process involves drilling a hole down to a layer of earth where there is natural gas, then pumping fluid into the hole at extreme pressures in order to fracture the stone and release the natural gas. It is only useful for particular rock formations that have lots of small pockets of natural gas that isn't easily accessed by other means. The main polution problem is apparently associated with dealing with the waste fluids after it as been used to fracture the rock. If the disposal wells are not properly sealed, they can leak up and into the water table (normally located at a much shallower depth than either the gas wells or waste wells), thus contaminating the drinking water. As with many things, it is safe as long as it is done properly, but not so much if the proper procedures are not followed.", "Picture oilfields as a sponge. Lots of little pockets of oil, instead of one massive underground 'tank' we can just suck out. To get into these little pockets, we drill a pipe into the formation and use explosive charges (or other more fancy tech) that poke little ~0.5\" holes in the pipe. Then we pump about 5000 gallons/minute through that hole, at crazy high pressure creating an effect like a really focused power washer on your mom's garden. This forces a crack into the formation, connecting all those little sponge holes to the pipe of our oil well. Sometimes this process is aided by Liquid Nitrogen, that expands as it goes down, giving it even more pressure at the bottom. Other times we run a slug of HCL to chemically soften the rock formation, making it easier to crack open. Now, this process is occurring 10,000ft++ below the surface, so the pressure is crazy high. Consider the extreme pressures you hear about at the bottom of the ocean, then remember it's deeper than that, and loaded with granite instead of water. That's the pressure the fracking pumps have to beat just to get the cracks open. If the pressure stops, those cracks will almost immediately seal up. To prevent this, immediately after the cracks have been formed we pump sand carried by gel down into the crack, which forces it to stay open. Since sand is very permeable, oil can flow freely through it to our pipeline. The gel carries a chemical that breaks it down within a few hours, and eventually makes its way up to the surface through the pipeline along with the oil. Most of the time this is Guar gel, and isn't too chemically different from using wheat flour to thicken a beef stew. It just cheaper and performs better at extreme temperatures and pressures. The cracks don't extend more than ~100ft from the pipeline. We know this because we can compare the volume of sand pumped down to the base diameter of the hole we blew open, and conservatively estimate the volume filled by the sand as a cone. Generally speaking, public water tables stop at ~100-200ft of the ground surface. Fracking is 10,000+, giving at least 800ft of solid rock between Fracking and Groundwater. It is incredibly unlikely that the two shall ever meet, and as far as I know they haven't. ~~~ What HAS happened is surface contamination. Small scale 'violations' occur almost every day when crews rig up and rig down, dribbling whatever chemical was in their hoses on the ground. These will fuck a farmer's backyard and grazing fields, but not likely a city's municipal water supply. The most ethical companies line a site with plastic sheeting and vacuum up any drippings, but that adds $1mil in cost, and is only as good as the crew applying it and actually doing what they're supposed to. Larger scale violations are some operations that have blatantly drained their runoff and (hazardous) wastewater tanks into the city sewer system, or some corner of a farm, hoping nobody would notice. This is patently illegal and amoral for so many reasons. Typically it's a \"discount hazardous waste disposal\" firm that's doing it for a bigger company, and usually the bigger company is included in the lawsuits for failing their due-dilligence. Other grey areas are the wastewater lakes for re-used water. See, the water that is pumped down into the formation comes back out a hazardous material and full of varying levels of nastiness. However, it doesn't become hazardous waste until it's actually waste. Most oilfield developers will re-use this water for \"tomorrow's\" fracking job, as it's still plenty good for that. That means the trucking/piping/transporting of that water with minimal spillage must be accounted for as well (read: more money). Also, it leaves you with wastewater that is even more hazardous than it was before. Typically this not-yet-wastewater is stored in engineered tanks or ponds that hold the bad stuff in to a reasonable (EPA certified) level, however, eventually someone will be responsible for draining that literal swamp. Usually that wastewater is pumped INTO an existing well in the center of a formation, which pushes oil OUT of surrounding wells. Once the stuff coming out is more water than oil, it's left 10,000ft underground, and won't be seen for a time measured on the geologic scale. Alternatively, there are ways to actually treat the water back to potable standards. It just requires processes and facilities tailored to the particular hazards of the water that aren't usually found at municipal water treatment plants. Drought-stricken farming areas have been kicking in for upgrades to their local water plants, as it actually can be cheaper to use local not-hazardous-anymore-but-expensively-treated water than trucking it in from elsewhere. ~~~ So, is Fracking safe? When working as-designed, yes. Of course there are things that can go wrong, but that's why local, state, and federal regulations require checks and constant monitoring. Having worked in the industry, I'm actually very pro-regulation, because I know the bosses will always put the business first. Without industry-wide regulation evening the playing field, someone will get over the moral issues of bad environmental practice in the name of cutting costs. The only downside to regulation is that it makes OUR oil more expensive to produce than countries that are less environmentally concerned, but I'm OK with that, because that just means keeping more in our borders. I should also note that Fracking has been tied to increased earthquakes. So far, most of the affected areas are also high-tornado areas, so their buildings are already ruggedized for those types of loads, which is why nothing has collapsed yet that wouldn't have anyway. However, the science isn't in yet on whether or not the more frequent earthquakes could be a good thing. See, we're about 60 years behind schedule for a massive New-Madrid earthquake, and there's now speculation that all of the little quakes could be easing the tension, preventing a massive snap that last made the Mississippi River flow backwards for a bit, and would certainly level most major cities between Louisiana and St. Louis.", "Its safety can be very controversial. Oil wells were first drilled straight down. After a while they learned to tilt the drill and drill at a slant. They became capable of turning a drill hole parallel to the layer with oil or gas. They learned to drill multiple holes from one drill site radiating out in the productive layer. They also learned to pack drill holes with sand, fluid, explosives, and nasty chemicals. Setting off the explosives resulted in fracturing the productive rocks. The sand slips in to keep the fracture open. The nasty chemicals also keep the cracks open. Because of these techniques it is now possible to get oil and gas from shale formations. More can be extracted. It is an oil and gas boom. Supposedly the well hole is sealed for a few thousand feet in the region which has our drinking water. So water wells should not become polluted. Actually water wells were polluted long before fracking. The roofs of well houses would pop off when the pump motor kicked on because of gas accumulation. There are cracks in the rocks. Anywhere you see quartz there is a crack in the rocks in which water seeped. Only a few thousand feet separate our aquifers and the oil or gas layers. Earthquakes happen all the time. So we may have set up a permanent future where aquifers and water wells are destroyed when the chemicals start leaching out. Drilling companies say they seal the hole. Actually at least 5 % of the seals fail within a number of years. We could say they will all eventually fail. It is just a matter of time.", "Bedrock is not a dense compact material. However it is more like lots of densely packed rocks. And between these there is cracks and openings for gas and liquids to get in. When you drill a well you get some of these cracks and can get the gases and liquids in them. This will cause material from connected cracks to flow towards your well. However depending on the rock and the cracks in them this can be a very slow process. Or the cracks can even get clogged by silt or other materials. One way to get higher gas or liquid throughput is to drill more wells. This is why you might see lots of wells in close proximity to each other. But drilling wells cost money. A cheaper method is to pump liquid down into the well and actually open up the cracks even more. After some time you get small pieces of sand and gravel that locks the cracks open. So when you pump the liquid back up again the cracks stay open and you can get more gas or liquid from the same well without drilling more. This is a technique which is hard to control and there is a lot of crossed fingers involved. You can not control the cracks in the rocks directly but have to rely on the rock to behave like you want it to. And in some cases you can open up the cracks too much and it can get though to nearby reservoirs that might be linked to the ground water. There is also worries about earthquakes since you are in fact moving bedrock and this can cause things to shift. We do have a lot of experience with this technology but not on the scale that we now see it being used. And it is hard to predict the outcome, it may be without risk one place and then with lots of risk at another site with seemingly identical geology."]}
{"prompt": "Why does the same radio station on FM and AM last much further out on AM?\nAn elaboration of the question: I listen to a sports station in Austin TX and when I leave the city the FM signal dies about 30 miles out of the city but the AM signal lasts for about 100 miles out.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["AM radio generally transmits around a frequency of 1 Mhz or less. FM radio generally transmits somewhere between 88 and 108 Mhz. Each FM photon has 100 times more energy than an AM photon (note: this is not the same as suggesting that the FM signals are automatically stronger because the power of the broadcasting tower will establish how many photons are sent out). Basically FM radio is mostly line of sight, the radio signals coming off the broadcasting tower more or less just shoot straight at you (straight at everything they can see from that vantage point) when you receive them they're basically coming in on a line between that broadcasting tower and you. As you get further away the tower passes beyond the horizon and you can't get the signal anymore. AM radio because each photon has less energy can both reach you by direct line-of-site like FM, but also the radio waves going upward into the sky cannot punch through the ionosphere well. The ionosphere is a layer of charged particles in the upper atmosphere, and it will reflect lower frequency radio waves back down to the earth extending their range considerably. With favorable conditions the signal can bounce multiple times off the atmosphere and then bounce off the earth and then the atmosphere again and travel very significant distances."]}

{"prompt": "How does satellite navigation work?\nAn elaboration of the question: I have a little bit of an understanding of this topic, but the part that still confuses me is since atomic clocks are needed to accurately measure the distance, how is my smart phone's clock accurate enough? And an explanation of why it takes 4 satellites would be appreciated!\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["If you know the distance between you and one satellite (whose position you know) then you could be anywhere on a sphere centered on that satellite with a radius of that distance. If you know the distances to two satellites then you could be anywhere in a circle: draw a triangle between you and the two satellites and that triangle is free to rotate around the line between the two satellites. If you know the distances to three satellites then you can only be in one of two positions: draw a triangluar pyramid between the three satellites and you and either that pyramid points down to your position on Earth or it points up into space. You can safely assume that you're on the ground. ****** That just uses three satellites and doesn't answer the question about clocks, though. The fourth satellite comes in to answer that question: your phone doesn't have an accurate enough clock to work with just three satellites, so rather than judging time by looking at the incoming time vs the phone's time you look at the incoming times compared to each other. Using this method if you receive one satellite you just know what time it is (with some error, since you don't know how far away that satellite is). With two satellites you know what time it is (again, with error) and how much farther you are from one satellite than the other. When you work out the consequences of this constraint you're left with a hyperbolic surface. The shape isn't important here; the important thing to note is that you get a surface, just like how in the first example one satellite gave the surface of a sphere. With three satellites you know one more piece of information. The result is that you could be anywhere on a line (just like how with the original example two satellites gives you a circle—just a line that's closed in on itself). Finally, with four satellites you get enough information that there's only one point that is consistent with all of the information you receive"]}

CANT FIGURE IT OUT\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["[This ]( URL_0 ) should help you out", "Just to provide a written answer... There's an axle that begins on your dial and goes through the center of several parallel disks (there's one for each number). But only the last disk is actually attached to this axle, all other disks in-between are loose. Each disk has a cutout notch. The disks' edges are dragging on a movable metal pin or tab (parallel to the axle) being pushed towards the disks by a spring. To defeat the lock, all disks' notches have to be aligned, which makes a straight gap going through the disks, and allows the pin/tab to slip inside said notches. So, when you start turning the dial, only the last disk moves. Somewhere on its surface there's a pin that's supposed to make contact and attach to a small tab on the surface of the next disk. When that happens, this next disk also starts moving. This pin/tab mechanism between each disk is made in a way that allows the attachment to happen in just one direction, this direction being inverted on each subsequent disk. But when one more disk gets \"picked\", all previous pin/tab attachment will stay locked for both directions. That's how the lock controls the alternating rotation. Therefore as you input each correct number on the correct direction, one more disk starts moving alongside your dial and all previously dialed disks are guaranteed to be kept on the right position, rotating as a whole. When you're entering the last number, you're actually rotating all disks as a single cylindrical pack with the notches perfectly aligned. If you move the dial on the wrong direction at any time, any previous pin/tab attachment will detach and you'll be back to moving only the first disk. The whole combination of the lock is given by the position of the pin relative to the notch on each disk."]}

{"prompt": "Why can cool drinks stay \"cool\" longer than hot drinks in the same insulated travel container, for example, an insulated tumbler or thermos.\nAn elaboration of the question: Many insulated containers advertise around 10-15 hours for something to stay cool, while only 4-6 hours for something to say hot, even if you prep the container by making it the same temperature as the contents before sealing. In an attempt to prolong desired temperature retention. I thought the increased delta of the temperature in the hotter items would equate to longer perceived \"hotness\" but that's not the case. Thanks in advance to everyone who comments!\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["My guess would be the difference between ambient and what it is you're trying to keep temperature controlled. A nice, cold drink may be at maybe 35-40°F. Ambient in a temperature-controlled office environment or a nice day might be 60-70°. So that leaves a difference of 20-35° for a cold drink. Compare that to keeping a hot drink at 160-185°F. The delta with ambient in this case would be 90-125°, far greater than the difference in the cold case. The larger difference means temperature of the hot drink will fall faster compared to how fast the cold drink warms up. Of course, being in hotter weather will shift this, but the difference doesn't hit even until you reach over 95°F. Most people don't stay out in that temperature for very long.", "The rate of heat transfer through a barrier directly relates to the temperature difference across that barrier. Say the outside temperature is 20 C and you have a cold drink at 5 C and a hot drink at 95C, then the temperature differences are 15 and 75 C respectively. That means the hot drink will lose heat five times as fast as the cold drink gains heat, at least to start with.", "Let's say you have a container of hot water at 180 degrees and another container with cold water at 35 degrees. If the outside air is 75 degrees, that's a difference of 105 degrees between the hot container and the outside and 40 degrees between the cold container and the outside. Since the hot container has a larger gradient of heat between it and the outside air, heat will flow away from the hot container faster than the cold container will absorb heat. Just like if you had a room of hot air, if you open the door to a room of cold air, the heat rushes out very quickly. But if you have a room of warm air, it flows more slowly to the cold room.", "Add to what others have said, the cold drink usually comes with ice in it which is intended to keep the drink cool longer. On the other hand the hot drink does not come with heated rocks in it to keep it hot longer. Then add condensation to the scenario. Here is a [school lesson]( URL_0 ) about two cold cups of water, one of which is inside a plastic bag: > The cup inside the bag should have very little moisture on it because not much water vapor from the air was able to contact it. The cup exposed to air should have more moisture on the outside because it was exposed to the water vapor in the air, which condensed on the outside of the cup. When condensation takes place, on the cup outer surface the water vapour present in the atmosphere becomes water particles there by releasing its latent heat. This helps to keep the cup cooler. This does not happen with a hot cup of water."]}
{"prompt": "The relationship between the clutch, the accelerator and the brake in a car\nAn elaboration of the question: I'm currently learning to drive a manual car, and I'm pretty confident now with changing gears, stopping and starting etc. but still occasionally stall and I'm not always sure why. My instructor's explained to me that I should let the clutch up more slowly but I'm not 100% on why that is. I feel like if I had a more concrete picture in my brain on what the three different pedals actually did, and the relationship between them, it would make it easier for me to avoid stalling.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The clutch slips to allow you to apply less than 100% of the engine's torque to the transmission. Depending on the gear selected, the engine might not be able to apply enough torque to propel the car without stalling (exceeding the engine's maximum torque). You can press the accelerator to increase engine speed, which also increases maximum torque. The balancing act of starting a manual car is to apply enough accelerator to keep then engine speed up while not letting the clutch out far enough to stall the car. As the car starts moving you can let the clutch out farther, as momentum will help keep the engine from stalling. You need to learn this as a muscle memory behavior, like shooting a basketball, because when you are driving you also have to look around and steer the car so you don't hit anything.", "- Accelerator pulls on the throttle and increases the speed of the engine. - Clutch disengages the gear from the engine; putting the car into neutral. - Brakes pushes the brake fluid into the brake pads; clamping the brake disc and as a result slowing the car down. When you're in first gear (with clutch in), the gear is disengaged and if you release it too quickly, your clutch grabs the gear instantly causing a jerk reaction which will cause you to stall because you're at a too low speed. When you're in a higher gear and you do this, your engine is spinning fast enough where the car won't stall; however you will feel the entire car jerk and somewhat pull you back. Novice drivers sometimes panic and hit the brakes which causes them to stall anyway. When you do release the clutch slowly while applying the gas/accerlerator, it gives the clutch a chance to ease into gear while when perfected; is so smooth that you won't even notice the change. ----------------------------- When you brake; it slows down the engine speed to the point where the higher gear spins at a speed where it wasn't designed to drive at (basically too slow for the gear) and so the car shakes voilently as it comes to a near stall speed. Most instructor will want you to stay in 5th/4th and slow down at the moment where it's about to stall before you engage the clutch (disengage the gear) and comes to a standstill and so you might want to practice that to pass your test. When you do drive on your own however, it saves your brake pads if you drop down a gear and let the engine do the braking. - Lower gears delivers more power but at the same time drops power more quicker than the higher gear; so putting a lower gear on and letting go of the accelerator will automatically slow the car down without the brakes. **Personal note**: Downshifting without using the brakes will cause this jerk reaction if the car is at too high of a speed. You can circumvent through this by simply engaging the clutch, blip your accelerator so the revs go higher (2-3k revs depending on the car) before releasing the clutch and doing your clutch accelerator method. **This lets you slow down without even using the brakes, however DO NOT DO THIS ON YOUR TEST!!!!!!!!!!!!**. -edit- **IMPORTANT NOTE:** WHEN I SAY DROP TO A LOWER GEAR; I MEANT 5 > 4 > 3; NOT 5 > 2."]}
{"prompt": "Is it possible to write an algorithm that corrects a low-quality speaker to sound good? If so, why is it not done?\nAn elaboration of the question: I assume the \"quality\" of a speaker depends on how equally the frequencies are present. You could easily measure how a (loud-)speaker reacts to certain frequencies and push those which are weak.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["It's not quite that simple, yes you can fix a nonlinear response with an equalizer, but you also need to deal with distortion. With a cheap speaker you might put in one frequency, and get a whole bunch of weird frequencies out, due to the resonances of the different parts the speaker is made of. There's also the issue of quality control, with cheap speakers you might not have perfectly consistent manufacturing, so you might need individual calibration data for each speaker coming off the line, that can get expensive. If you want to calibrate it after installing it at home, you'd need a microphone that's been well characterized, and the device playing your music needs to be able to do the signal processing required to correct all the speaker's deficiencies. That would probably require some engineering to model the behavior of the speaker, or maybe continuous feedback from a microphone into the signal processor. (say some of your distortion is caused by one of the panels of your enclosure vibrating, you might know the frequency at which it vibrates from the initial calibration, but to dampen it out you need to know the phase, so your correction interferes destructively with that vibration instead of interfering constructively and making the distortion worse) Also, the speaker's characteristics might change as the speaker ages, absorbs moisture from the air, with changes of air pressure, etc. Finally, maybe the people making cheap speakers don't have the motivation or expertise to pull something like this off, while the people making expensive speakers want to keep selling expensive speakers.

Can someone help me speak computer??\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Disclaimer: not an expert, I actually have no experience in C but I have a grasp of the concepts. Most common programming languages that you see or hear of today, be it Java, C++, or the web dev trio, HTML/CSS/Javascript, are what's known as 'high level languages' and typically go through several layers of abstraction before they're able to be executed by the machine directly. (For example, Java runs on another program called the JVM, which translates it's code into code for the platform it's running on, which is why it's so portable across operating systems) High-level languages generally abstract away concepts like pointers (which 'point' to a specific position in memory, which is helpful for remembering where you stored a value), and you're left with variable names which essentially do the same thing but don't have a lot of the difficulty associated with pointers. (These probably make up about half of those random letters and words, the other half being functions) C is a significantly lower-level language, but it also gives you more direct control over memory. You can directly manipulate segments of memory rather than having a memory management system do it for you. It's also commonly used in robotics because it's excellent for single-purpose tasks like translating a physical button into turning on a motor. Now, these definitions don't exactly answer your question. Programming is generally very structured and has specific naming patterns, and they can seem confusing or otherwise incomprehensible by the average layman. In low level programming such as C, you're generally going to see two major types of things being named: Pointers/Variables and functions. Functions are like mathematical functions, except that they can be called any time and can obviously do a lot more than just mathematics. Variables, or pointers in lower-level languages, basically store directions to getting a specific value in memory. These values can be simple, like a number or a boolean (true/false value), but they can also be more complex, carefully ordered structs (To people who know C, C has structs, right?) which can contain many values. Now, functions and variables can be named just about anything, and C's standard libraries (the functions which \"come with\" C) often have very confusing naming schemes. It's a matter of having the proper documentation on hand. Learning programming can be a tricky task, but there's many ways to get help and resources. Other redditors, if you would kindly link some, go ahead. I'm too lazy at the moment. Also please correct me if I made some huge mistake, or tiny mistake if you choose."]}

Given that drinking water pipes are not regularly flushed out with bleach or something, how is it that drinking water is not totally filthy from going through dirty pipes? Edit: thanks for all the responses guys! Especially from the water treatment and plumbing experts. Didn't expect to get such a big reaction!\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["> drinking water pipes are not regularly flushed out with bleach or something They are, essentially. Drinking water supplies contain a low concentration of chlorine bleach or another disinfectant to prevent germs growing. Also the pipes are sealed, with valves and taps designed to prevent air containing germs being drawn in, and they're opaque so light algae need to grow doesn't get in. EDIT: As many people have mentioned, not all places and countries leave the disinfectant in the water. Ensuring that it's clean when it enters the pipes - either with chemicals that are removed or with UV light - along with the pipes being airtight and dark and unfavourable to life is when done correctly enough to keep the water clean.", "Public water supplies DO have chemicals added, but for people like me that live in rural areas with private wells, essentially it's just the process of using the water on a regular basis that keeps it fresh. Algea and such come from surface contamination, but well water left in pipes for a few weeks or more may get stagnant or have rust from old steel pipes. Last summer I inadvertantly left my garden hose running all day and ran my well dry. After it finally refilled in a day or two from the surrounding ground water, I had to \"reprime\" the system and let the water run to clear out large contaminants like minerals and rust. The water smelled funny and was brownish for a few days. Even under normal circumstances, I probably ingest small amounts of of microscopic minerals, small celled organisms, rust,etc. Not enough to be harmful, some of the minerals might even be good for me. Remember, humanity has been drinking \"dirty\" water out in nature for most of our existence.", "To add, modern construction uses copper pipes from the municipal main and throughout the entire house. Copper is self disinfecting, as it's toxic to microbial life. That's not why we use copper, we use it because it's cheap and easy to work with, but it's a convenient consequence. If there were microbes in your plumbing, the surface of the pipes would be a hostile environment for them.", "As someone who designs municipal water systems, if you have a length of pipe that isn't being used enough and the water sits for more than 48 hours, it is considered stagnant. This is a condition to be avoided. To prevent this, we make sure to connect the water system to itself at many points to increase flow, not use excessive pipe sizes and avoid dead ends in the system.", "It greatly depends the country you're in. A lot of commenters here mention chlorine as main means of desinfection, combined with copper piping. That certainly is the case in the US and many other countries. In other countries, like the Netherlands where I live, chlorine desinfection isn't common practice. Only 20÷ of households in the Netherlands recieve chlorinated water and in that case chlorine isn't used as a primary desinfectant (as that's not allowed), so the chlorine concentrations are very low. Primary means of desinfection is UV or ozon treatment (at the treatment plant). Growth of biological contaminents in the (mostly PE or PVC) piping is prefented by making sure no contaminents are present in the water before it enters the system, combined with measures to prefent introducing contaminents during transport, such as desinfecting piping with silverperoxide before use and mandatory anti-backflush valves at house connections. Apart from the methods mentioned above, there are many more options that are used around the globe, with fluctuating results; in some countries tap meets drinking water standards, sometimes even of better quality than bottled water (like in the Netherlands), in some countries tap water isn't meant for consumption as drinking water but only for use. While the Dutch take great pride in their drinking water quality, something could also be said for not cleaning the water you use for your washer / dishwasher / shower up to drinking water standards.", "Plumber here, this is actually a concern for unused pipes, when a house is connected to a municipal water supply it receives treated water. That water treatment includes chlorine which among other things kills bacteria. Water quality varies from house to house and so additional treatment is sometimes necessary to maintain good quality. As long as the water is not stagnant In the pipes the system should be maintained at a satisfactory level. Water quality is a semi complicated subject but that is a very basic explanation.", "Water Treatment Operator here. In the drinking water plant they add more chlorine to the water than is necessary to deal with any of the bugs that lived in it. This leaves extra floating about ready to deal with any other bugs it might possibly encounter in the pipes under the road or in your own house. On top of that to make sure that there is always water with some of that extra chlorine in it operators will sometimes run taps at the dead ends of the underground pipes. These constantly run water, and make sure that the older water gets pushed out of the dead end pipe by fresher water. Also, operators like me (or people we pay) will routinely go around to fire hydrants and open them up full bore and spray a bunch of water all over the roads or into ditches or whatever. This not only makes sure fresh water gets to all the pipes, it also makes the water run really fast through the pipes and it scours off any bugs, or buildup in which they could live, and spews them out of the hydrants.", "Quantity Surveyor for a water contractor in the U.K. Here. We operate a service called Trunk Mains Cleaning which basically uses a giant spinning metal brush to clean the insides of large diameter mains. The debris is then flushed out at terminal or inline hydrants. This process will commonly cause small problems later with sand and debris coming out of the supply pipes at customers houses which plumbers then have to flush out for us. When water mains get to old the infrastructure maintenance program that we have uses a method called pipe bursting to replace old ductile iron pipe with new P.E pipe of the same or larger diameter (a machine with a large arrow head smashes through the old pipe while dragging fresh pipe in behind it). Tldr Large mains are cleaned with a big brush, small mains and service pipes are flushed or, if they are to old, burst through and replaced with the same or larger diameter pipe.", "Those organisms need soluble oxygen and sunlight as an energy source to grow and develop; sealed water mains are considered a zero oxygen environment and does not have any sunlight getting to the water. The water utility I manage does not leave a small amount of chlorine in out distribution system (called precautionary disinfection), we do not chlorinate at all, the water we drink come straight from the ground to our storage tank. We also are required by CalEPA to conduct monthly monitoring of our distribution system for bacterial contamination, positive hits occur rarely.

{"prompt": "why do you need to switch on so many things when starting a helicopter?\nAn elaboration of the question: What are all those switches controlling? Couldn't it be replaced with a single switch for the whole process? Does it happen that you flight a helicopter without turning on several things?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["In not only helicopters but most aircraft there are several systems needed in order to sustain flight, such as hydraulic systems, fuel systems, bleed air systems (air supplied by the jet engine providing lift), air conditioning and oxygen, lights, navigation and communication, and electric systems. There could also be multiple systems for redundancy/emergency. All of these switches are turned off to conserve power, make maintenance easier, and prevent accidents. Edit: words", "I think this has been answered pretty well, but I wanted to draw a comparison to cars to maybe shed more light on it. I fly airplanes, not helicopters, but a lot of the instrumentation and controls are similar. My car has a push-button to start the engine if the radio key is in your pocket. When you push the button, the car's computer negotiates with the key then turns on an electric fuel pump, primes the engine, turns on the starter motor, and enables the ignition system. Once the computer detects that the engine is running, it shuts off the starter motor and turns on the dashboard lights, the radio, and the daytime running lights. While you're driving, the computer monitors a hundred different sensors to make adjustments to fuel/air mixture, ignition timing, and emissions controls, while also monitoring the electrical and charging system. When you want to turn the turn signals, headlights, tail lights, or fog lights on/off, you probably move a single switch which controls all those lights in different combinations. Here's the catch - that computer is a single point of failure for *every single system on the car*. They seem super reliable; lots of people will drive hundreds of thousands of miles without a hiccup from that system. But not everyone - cars occasionally stop communicating with the key, sensors occasionally fail and confuse the system, and electronics occasionally do unexpected things. If you've owned a newer car and gotten recall notices, you'll see a similar trend. For a car, this is a bit of an inconvenience, and you might get stuck in a bad neighborhood or by the side of the road at night. For an airplane or helicopter, this is not an inconvenience, it's a full-on emergency. You can't pull over because the computer flaked out. Aviation is all about separate systems - no matter how confused the battery charging system gets, there's no way for it to affect the ignition system (in fact, airplanes mostly still use an ignition system called a magneto, which was phased out for more efficient, flexible systems in cars by the mid-1930's, because it's fully self-contained - an aircraft engine can run indefinitely with no electricity or outside control or monitoring, as long as you keep giving it fuel). So instead of having a computer overlord turn on all those systems, each one has its own switch for the pilot to operate: 1. Master battery switch - This does make for a single point of failure for the electrical system, but it's not a cheap switch and it still has no control over the engine. 2. Electric fuel pump - This is a secondary pump to supplement the mechanical pump in the engine during critical phases of flight (more redundancy). 5. Priming pump - not a switch, usually a manual pump with a plunger sticking out of the panel. 4. Ignition switch - probably a key in private aircraft, might be a simple switch in military stuff. Selects either or both magnetos to give the pilot control over how the engine is running. 2. Starter motor - hold until the engine is running, then let go. 2. Master avionics switch - Sends power to the flight instruments. 2. Radio switch - Turns on the communication and navigation radios. 6. Strobe light. 5. Navigation lights - wingtips, etc, maybe also instrument panel lights (same idea as car tail lights). 6. Landing light (same idea as headlight). 0. Pitot tube heat - electric heating element to make sure your speedometer keeps working in bad weather. On top of all that, when the pilot is starting they plane they'll probably be changing radio frequencies to get a weather update or flight clearance, and changing settings on the various instruments to suit that flight. And, there are levers to control the fuel/air mixture and a few other things modern cars adjust for themselves. All told, they have to handle more than a dozen controls on the dashboard, because we can't trust a computer to manage all those things reliably enough. And this is on a simple single-engine prop plane; anything with a jet engine, multiple engines, oxygen systems, pressurization, or autopilot typically adds a couple extra switches for those systems."]}

{"prompt": "How was it possible for electric cars to exist 100 years ago when the technology only recently became mature enough to become practical?\nAn elaboration of the question: And what kinds of batteries did they use? It seems to me that electric cars are becoming popular right now in large part because the necessary technology has advanced enough for it to be practical. With the newest batteries and efficient motors and what not electric cars seem to finally be able to compete with gas-powered cars. How could they possibly have worked a hundred years ago?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["125-150 years ago cars were a relatively new technology, and it wasn't at all clear that gasoline-powered internal combustion engines were the way to go. Back then the differences between the two were not as extreme. In particular, it was the introduction of mass production by Henry Ford in 1908 with the Ford Model T (which used a gasoline-powered internal combustion engine) that heavily contributed to tipping the scales in favor of gas-powered cars. So gasoline-powered internal combustion \"won.\" As cars powered by internal combustion engines became cheaper to produce and thus more readily available, investment in furthering the technology of electric-powered vehicles decreased. That said, it's really kind of unfair to characterize electric cars as \"finally\" able to compete with gas cars. Gasoline powered internal-combustion received hundreds of billions of dollars in investment over the last 100 years; electric cars didn't. It wasn't until the gasoline shortages of the 70's and 80's that the industry started thinking about investing in electric vehicle technology again. If both technologies had received equivalent R & D over the last century, electric vehicles would have been competitive long ago. But that's not how technological progress occurs. In the early stages of development of a new technology, there are typically a number of competing options, but eventually an industry gravitates to a smaller number of options -- or even one option -- because of some particular advantages (typically cheaper to produce). Then the lion's share of investment gets committed to _that_ option, and it progresses faster than the other options, cementing it's lead. Eventually, though, as alternative technologies continue to slowly develop or faults in the \"winning\" technology become apparent in the long-term (e.g. with cars, fossil fuels' impact on the climate), another option that in the past might have been more expensive to produce or less efficient or whatever, starts to become cheaper or more efficient and can re-emerge. Partially, this is what's happening with electric vehicles. tl;dr -- If Henry Ford had gone with an electric engine instead of a gasoline-powered internal combustion engine, the history of transportation would have been different.", "Electric cars of the 1880s were very fragile things with very short range and heavy (for the time) batteries, just like electric cars of 1980s and 1990s. But back in those days, competing petrol cars were no good either. They were a nightmare to maintain, hard to start, hard to drive (controls were nothing like today's cars) and you needed good mechanic skills to drive them. Electric cars, in comparison, were only a little slower but much easier to start, stop, maintain and repair. They were often preferred by women drivers and those who didn't want/afford to hire a driver.", "The big difference now is new kinds of batteries. Interestingly, when the car was a new idea, running one on steam or electricity was as valid as petrol. In cities, electric may have seemed preferable. The big disadvantage was basically how far the car could go on the batteries it carried. In them says I guess it would have been simple lead acid? New Lithium Iron batteries get you much better range for their weight. If you are ever in stuttgart, you can see one of the first Porsche cars at the museum and that's electric."]}

Purported Benefits: Tradition generally drives the use of this glass, which is usually reserved for Belgian witbier and lambic.", "The shape of the glass affects how your mouth and nose (eyes to an extent) interact with the beverage. A very wide glass will allow your whole nose to enter the glass as you sip it, the aroma adds to and complements the taste. A very narrow glass like a champagne flute reduces surface area which keeps the bubbly bubbles from gassing out before you can drink it. Other glasses like a Brandy snifter allow to you swirl the beverage without spilling it, the swirling allows the aroma to release but the narrow lip of the glass traps most of it in the glass, so you can get your nose right in there. Some glasses have stems to keep your body heat out of the beverages while other glasses encourage the handling to warm the drink inside. Certain beer glasses have wider tops which allows the head to form and remain which contributes to aroma and protects the beer below from reacting with the oxygen in the air.

Taste is related to smell, so a glass that has room for your nose will allow you to 'experience' more of the drink. In beer glasses, some shapes allow for more foam (or head), and that is often part of the taste of the beer (like Guinness or Boddingtons). Different shapes also have different surface areas.

{"prompt": "What happens if I were to connect a NAND gate to one of it's inputs, then power the other input? Would it make some sort of clock cycle?\nAn elaboration of the question: Title. Basically I was wondering, well if you take a NAND gate, then power one input and connect the output (emitter?) to the other input (collector?) will it make a really fast clock cycle? Or will it just explode?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Electrical Engineer here. TL;DR, no. It'll reach some steady state where the output voltage equals the input voltage, but it doesn't represent a 1 or a 0. If you want it to oscillate, you need to chain multiple inverters (your 1-input NAND gate). This is called a ring oscillator, and it works because the delay across multiple inverters prevents any of them from reaching the steady state. NAND gates (and really any electronic device) are ultimately analog components. This is important because the way devices behave are dependent on the voltage of the inputs, and not all voltages translate to a logic value. Let's simplify your scenario a little. Think of an inverter (1- > 0, 0- > 1). In reality, logic 1 is really some voltage, call it 5V, and logic zero is another voltage, 0V (generally a little higher than ground, but it doesn't matter). You can think of the inverter as a device that maps 5V- > 0V, and 0V- > 5V. What about a voltage somewhere in the middle of 5V and 0V? Picture a graph, the x-axis is the input voltage, and the y-axis is the output voltage. You know you have two points, (0, 5) and (5, 0). Now draw a line that connects them. That line represents the inverter (or at least a linear model of one). Vout = 5V - Vin. This is a little simplified, but you'll get the picture. Now, think about what happens as the output swings. Say I start at 5V. The inverter will start to move towards 0V. But this changes the input. Let's say we're now at 4V, the output will want to go to 1V. Now we're at 3V. The output wants to be at 2V. At 2.5V, the output wants to be at 2.5V. The inverter is stuck! The input voltage maps exactly to itself. You might get a little oscillation because there is a delay between the input and output, but each time around it will get closer to 2.5V, and eventually it'll reach a steady state. Now, if you chain multiple inverters, the delay from the output of an inverter, through all the others, and back into its own input will be large, and the inverter can get to the desired voltage output before the input changes. This is what we call a ring oscillator. Each inverter adds a little delay, and if the chain around takes longer than the time it takes for the inverters to swing their output, you'll get permanent oscillations, otherwise it'll die off eventually."]}

In the modern day, it's more likely that your blinkers use solid state electronics with an artificial 'click' to match people's expectations.", "There is usually a clicker of some sorts under the dash... whether electric(usually within a relay) or mechanical. It's only purpose is to remind you that your turn signal is on.", "Actually, the [mechanism of a blinker]( URL_0 ) consists of a bent piece of metal that gets hot when current passes through it (to light up the signal lights); the metal dilates because of the heat, and thus moves away from the contact and interrupts the circuit to the lights. Without the current, the metal then gets cold and moves back into the initial contact position. Basically, it's a switch that uses the fact that electricity produces heat, and heat can make a metal change its shape/size. So that's how the clicking happens, that piece of metal clicking in and out of contact. That's also why the signal lights on (some) cars blink faster when one of the signal bulbs is burned out (the remaining signal light bulb has a different electrical resistance than 2 bulbs)."]}

{"prompt": "How are manufactured products of measurement like measuring tapes, cups, scales etc calibrated.\nAn elaboration of the question: What is the standard method. If you get a measuring tape from Stanley, Kobalt, or Black and Decker, baring any defects, the marks are all the same (of course) If I buy 5 scales, from 5 companies, i know they are all going to be conclusive. What standardized method do these companies use to make sure their table spoon is in fact a table spoon.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The rule of thumb is whatever process you're making, the standard against which you judge the product is 1 order of magnitude finer. If the finest discrimination of your school ruler or measuring tape is 1mm or 1/16\" (0.0625 in.), then those were made with tools that had to be accurate to 0.1mm or 0.006\". Because 0.1mm is 0.00254 inches, the finest precision there is about 0.001, so the *tools* used to make the rulers and tape were AT LEAST accurate to 1 thousandth of an inch or so. Those tools would've been made and measured to be accurate with calibration tools accurate to 0.0001\", and those calibration tools would be referenced against a tool-making standard like gauge blocks, which would be accurate to AT LEAST 0.00001\", and so on. Toolmaker's equipment often must be re-calibrated or evaluated for its accuracy. Tool-making equipment is often so precise that you shouldn't touch it without gloves: the contaminants and oils on your skin could affect it. Such instruments also must be kept in a temperature-controlled room to keep them from thermal distortions. Length is standardized according to the meter as the perfect ideal: it's defined as the wavelength of red light emitted from a certain elemental isotope.

Ultimately all measuring devices are calibrated using a single master device (of that type) kept in France under very strict storage conditions."]}
{"prompt": "How does bump starting a car actually work?\nAn elaboration of the question: I know literally nothing about a car underneath the bonnet, I only know how to drive them. Question comes after bump starting my mates car the other day. Why is it easier in 2nd/3rd gear? Does it damage the engine to keep doing this? What actually causes the engine to tick over etc?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["A cars engine is designed to be self sufficient once it is going. The revolution of the motor drives all the components, such as fuel delivery, electrical, lubrication, cooling, etc. when you start your car, an electric starter motor is used to get the engine turning and start the self sustaining process. In the case of a pop start, the electric starter motor is not used. You have to find a way get the crank shaft spinning so that it can drive all the components. By rolling the car in neutral, you get the transmission spinning. When you then dump the clutch, the clutch pressure plate will connect to the spinning flywheel, which in turn gets the crankshaft of the engine to start spinning (the same effect the starter motor has) and the engine will start. As far as starting in 2nd or 3rd gear it has to do whith mechanical advantage. 1st gear has the most mechanical advantage, meaning that in 1st gear one revolution of the engine produces the least number of revolutions on the tires. So it stands to reason that the opposite is true when trying to pop start a car. If you try it in first gear, the low gear ratio of 1st will translate into a slower spin of the crankshaft and may not be enough to get the motor to start. By selecting 2nd gear or 3rd gear, when the clutch engages it will spin the crankshaft faster and give you a better chance of spinning the crankshaft fast enough to start the engine. As far as damaging the engine, it really doesn't hurt the engine. The only thing it does do is add extra wear and tear to the clutch in your transmission. The clutch uses friction to link the spinning crankshaft to the drive shaft. When pop starting, the rotating clutch is smashed up against the stationary flywheel, which can wear down the clutch. It's not a totally damaging thing to do by any means, but it's wise to only do it if you have to.", "Lets start with how an engine works. You have pistons which compress gasoline and then it gets ignited. The explosion drives the piston back, which cause a different piston to compress gasoline. But when an engine is stopped you can't compress the gasoline. Modern cars have when is called a Starter Motor, which is an electric motor that turns the engine to get it started. Old engines, or if your starter motor is broken, require a Bump Start or Push Start. The means turning the engine to till it starts. This could be pushing a car or spinning the propellers on a plane. Why you would do this in 2nd or 3rd gear is that it will take less force to push the car, but not a high enough gear that once the engine starts it would stall out at such a low speed."]}
{"prompt": "How/Why are game developers able to code anti-piracy measures like in pirated copies of ARMAII where the player seems drunk, but can't/don't just code the game to just not work or load at all?\nAn elaboration of the question: I watched this video that showed some cool anti piracy measure game developers have done. Many of them were just trolly things messing with the user who has a pirated copy. I was wondering if they game developers can detect that copy is pirated and trigger something that makes the game run these ways, why can't they just stop the games from being played all together?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["From what I understand, developers make these special versions and send them to torrent sites themselves. So, people who illegally download get a mostly working version that they think is bugged instead of intentionally tampered with. The more it seems like a mechanic or bug, the less they'll catch on and try and find a different torrent. And when it is more common knowledge, people will call them out for pirating when they post on forums for help.", "There are basically two types of anti-piracy measures: 1. Anti-piracy measures build into the \"proper\" game, this means even legally acquired versions have them. These are not the \"funny\" measures you mention and they mostly lead to the game being unplayable (sometimes even for legit buyers), e.g. Drakensang which among other measures stopped spawning quest-important characters as soon as it detected piracy software running (e.g. Daemon tools). 2. Anti-piracy measures build into a \"fake\" version of the game which is intentionally distributed on piracy channels to send a message, confuse people and make the pirating experience worse. Most companies just decide to upload versions which trackers to nail pirates but other companies get more creative like you described. However these \"effects\" are not part of the \"proper game\" and they also don't trigger by detecting pirated versions, they are just a fixed part of them.", "Honestly, if the game simply refuses to run, it makes it easier for the pirate to crack in the first place. Pirates often crack games by tinkering around with the game's executable file, deleting or replacing bits of code and then running the game to see if it works or not (Denuvo, which is the current go-to DRM for developers/publishers, works by preventing tampering with the executable file directly). If the game doesn't start up, then good, they've eliminated one option and they move on. If a game's anti-piracy mechanic consists of freezing mid-way into the final boss fight and deleting your save, with literally no changes to the game beforehand, well, that's a bit tougher nut to crack.

{"prompt": "Why can you switch gears without using the clutch?\nAn elaboration of the question: New to this. A co-worker was trying to explain to me how he can shift without using the clutch, but I'm pretty sure he confused himself while confusing me.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Because on a mechanical level, when you can change gears without the clutch, it is because the input and output shafts are rotating at the same speed, and without tensions on the gears. The gears are able to move in and out smoothly. It can be potentially more damaging to the transmission in a vehicle with synchronizers to shift without a clutch, just because of how it's made. You do see floating gears a LOT in the trucking world (heavy duty) though. Truck transmissions do not have synchronizers, so double clutching or floating is required to change gears. Synchronizers, on a basic level, match the speeds of the input and output shafts, so the gears on each shaft don't grind when they interact.", "In a modern manual transmission the actual gear wheels are in constant contact but freely spin on the output shaft, and the gear selector mechanically connects just one gear wheel at a time to the output shaft. An additional 'synchromesh' allows some slippage. It's only meant to match the gearbox speed to the road speed while the main clutch is depressed, and then releasing the main clutch handles matching the engine speed to that, but the synchros can be misused to do all the clutching. To do this smoothly the engine speed must be set appropriately by the driver using the accelerator, called 'rev matching'. Even then, imperfect rev matching when shifting without using the clutch will wear out the synchros. I advise don't do it routinely in a car you care about.", "If you find the sweet spot in the rpm's, then the clutch becomes unnecessary. Since there is no tension on the gears it can shift in and out smoothly."]}

{"prompt": "What makes a telescope different than a telephoto lens?\nAn elaboration of the question: Besides the obvious mount for a camera, being made to withstand rigors of the road, and a logo on the side, what's mechanically different about a telescope that makes it so special?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["A telescope and a long focal length camera lens do pretty much the same job, but there are some differences: * Camera lenses nearly always use just lenses. Telescopes can use lenses, mirrors, or both. * Camera lenses are designed to focus over a range of distances, which can mean compromises. Telescopes are designed purely for focusing on distant stars, 'infinity' in photography terms. * Telescopes are designed to capture as much light as possible. That usually means just two or three glass elements because each surface loses some light. Camera lenses don't worry about that so much and often have lots of glass elements. * Camera lenses are designed for use with variable aperture - the diameter of the opening for light to go through. They may compromise sharpness at wide aperture, and they need a clear light path down the middle for small aperture (which is one reason they rarely use mirror designs). Telescopes are generally designed for use 'wide-open' only and need to perform well at it. * Long focal length camera lenses invariably use the 'telephoto group', a lens arrangement to make the focal length longer than the physical length. Long focal length telescopes are often physically long, although not always. * Telescopes get physically much wider - again, it's light transmission. For example the Skywatcher Skyliner 300P is a £1000 amateur telescope with a 300 mm (12 inch) diameter main mirror. In camera terms it's a 1500 mm f/5 (mirror) lens, and a comparable camera lens would cost over ten times as much. And that's just amateur stuff - professional astronomers use telescopes with main mirrors several *metres* across. * Camera lenses have autofocus. Amateur telescopes usually have manual focus. * For photography, normal photographers use exposure times of fractions of a second. Astronomy photographers use exposures of several *minutes*. That means the mounting needs to be rock solid, far more so than a typical camera tripod, and also compensate for the Earth's rotation. Because of the 'bang for your buck' performance, terrestrial photographers interested in extreme telephoto shooting often turn to amateur astronomical telescopes despite the drawbacks."]}
{"prompt": "why do wood fires burn so slowly, but house fires with even greater area to cover seem to be rather quick?\nAn elaboration of the question: Whenever I'm camping and light a fire, it generally takes a hours until the wood burns completely through, but whenever I hear about a house fire on the news, it seems like houses can almost completely burn down before the FD even gets there. Why is it that the wooden structure of a house burns so quick when camp fires don't?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The wooden structure itself actually doesn't burn that fast, and if you look at the remains of a structure fire, you'll notice that a lot of the wood is mostly in tact. The fire just weakens it enough for it to collapse, if it does at all. It's the furniture, carpets, etc. that burn so fast. Especially curtains. Curtains are a HUGE fire hazard.", "In addition to the other comments, the structure of a standard campfire (3-4 logs making a triangle into each other) contributes to it. In this campfire, the logs burn, some of the heat radiates into the other logs, but most of it rises, away from the campfire, and into the air. This heat is lost, and it flies away. The flames on the log crawl up the log at about a 45 degree angle, where they contact a small amount of neighboring wood, and a lot of air. You may notice that as the logs ember, they drop coals in a pile under the logs. These embers sustain the fire by radiating the heat upward (into the logs) and empowering the flames on the underside of the logs. In a housefire, the fire doesn't radiate the heat away. (until you breach a wall, or ceiling) The heat radiates into nearby furniture, walls, whatever, retaining that heat. This spreads the fire much faster by having everything heat up. For flames on a vertical wall, the actual flame is in contact with the wood directly above it, far more than a log at 45 degrees, which accelerates the burning of that piece of wood. In a housefire, there is also a much greater quantity of fuel. As the wood starts embering, there is simply so much more fuel to burn. The embers land, spread their heat to their surroundings and then those surroundings burn and ember and so forth. The fact that a house is a box-like structure means that it contains the heat and accumulates it, like an oven, whereas an open campfire is always losing heat to the air and wind. TL:DR - fire burning things is a reaction that is controlled by the amount of heat being retained, the amount of fuel in contact with flame. Houses on fire hold the heat, spread it more effectively, and are simply larger.", "I'm a person responsible for fire testing of architectural products and here is my take on it. A commercial or residential window shade will burn if in the path of a flame, otherwise it self extinguishes. Similarly the walls and furniture will burn if in contact with a flame from a source like a carpet or other flooring surface. Ceiling tiles will burn if in path of a flame off of desks and sofas. The intensity of the fire will determine the flame height and the materials in the room affected by the flame. The reason the campfire takes so long is because the logs were not stacked in order to enable the lower burning logs to ignite those above them. Next time try slicing the log with slits in it and see how much faster it burns. It has to do with accessibility to air. A solid log burns slowly while the slit logs burns faster because the air reaches inside the slits. Any burnable surface in contact with both air and a flame will burn quickly.", "I work wit a volunteer fire fighter. We were talking about the speed difference in modern and old houses. Modern houses are filled with plastic and synthetic material so burn damn fast! Old wooden houses are much slower.", "Its about surface area as much as anything else. Yes there may differences in flammability but surface area is much more important. The greater the surface area the greater the exposure to oxygen.", "I think the real answer is that you are comparing the acceleration of a fire to complete consumption. If a house fire was to lead to the complete consumption of the available fuel it would take a very long time."]}
{"prompt": "a major problem with renewable energy like wind and solar is storing energy when the source (wind or sunshine) is not available. Why can't they just use water?\nAn elaboration of the question: You could use excess electricity to power pumps to pump water to a higher elevation, and when there is less power than normal let it fall back down and power a turbine or something. Obviously this wouldn't work for something mobile like a car, but why couldn't it work for a stationary power plant? It seems a lot more practical for storing huge amounts of power than huge arrays of lithium or lead batteries. Hell, even if it's inefficient it's still probably cheaper and more environmentally friendly than mining all that lead and/or lithium.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["This is called pumped storage and it's commonly used wherever there is a good place to put a reservoir in. But there are many places in the world where there isn't a convenient large hill nearby, and because of the huge amount of water involved it's not possible to build something from scratch on flat ground.", "This is being done. If you look at the new additions to the high power grid of Europe a lot of the new lines are between mountainous regions in the alps and Scandinavia where they have a lot of hydroelectric power plants and flat areas where there is more wind and solar as well as more cities. This is in preparation to go away from coal and gas. But even this might be enough. The problem is with high speed pickups. When you switch on a kettle that energy have to be already in the power grid. It is not enough to have it in form of water on top of a mountain. In traditional coal, hydro, gas or nuclear power plants there is a big heavy turbine that contains a lot of energy. When you switch on your kettle the turbines will move a tiny bit slower as you use their energy. To keep up the speed there is a need to change the flow of water to the turbine but this is a process that takes seconds. The turbine have lots of energy that is available in milliseconds to anywhere in the grid where it is needed. So to keep a pumping hydro plant working you would have to run the turbines all the time to keep them spinning. And the pumping is not going to be as efficient as you might think. Nuclear power is a very good option and does complement the existing hydro plants and allows for more wind and solar as well. We have mastered the safety aspects of it and can make very safe reactors if we are able to respect it and manage it properly."]}
{"prompt": "Why is all glass not safety glass?\nAn elaboration of the question: Just dropped a beaker at work and it got me thinking why all glass isnt configured the way lets say a windshield or window is.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["for general use, cost. car windshield glass is laminated. it's actually two pieces of glass with a clear glue in the middle. it doesn't shatter into million pieces when it breaks. windshield glass also needs to be mostly distortion free. you'll note that windshields are bent, but when you look thru them, the image is not bent. car side window glass is not laminated, but it's still special glass. it's tempered. it's stronger than just \"normal\" glass. but it shatters into many pieces when it breaks. then there's glass made for ever other specialty application. optical glass doesn't need to be super strong or not shatter. it needs to be very clear and very distortion free. gorilla glass is very scratch and shatter resistant. and very pricey. UV protection glass filters out UV light. residential window glass is treated for filtering our both UV and IR light.", "Most probable reason? Price. Plain glass is much cheaper than shock resistant glass, or even scratch resistant glass or so. All these improvements make the product a tad more expensive and sometimes this difference gets bit enough to matter. We could also say that in some situations a heat tempered glass piece is just plain stupid. Imagine if a window in you house got hit by a sharp rock. If it was a heat tempered piece it would shatter in a million pieces and cleaning that would be a pain in the butt. Now, if we use plain glass it just breaks into big chunks near the impact. See?

{"prompt": "Why isn't the power grid underground like plumbing/sewers/water lines?\nAn elaboration of the question: Wouldnt this reduce outages since there are no poles to knock over or power lines to get hit by falling branches etc?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["It is sometimes. Running power underground is expensive, but will fail less often. But when it does break, it's expensive to repair. Running power overhead is cheap. It's more fragile, but also quick and easy to repair. Water and sewer lines are underground for some key reasons. One, they are heavy. Very heavy. So not only do you need very strong towers to hold them, if they fall they can do some serious damage. And also, they are gravity driven. Especially for the sewers, those lines need to be below that of your house so that things will drain away. Electricity doesn't care about gravity.", "Especially with high voltage (carrying over long distance) lines, there is an immense cost in underground lines. One of the reasons is that air is actually a pretty good insulator. But it can't be used as an insulator in buried cables. To insulate those high-class lines, a lot of material is required, which also means the cables will be quite large when buried. In addition, underground cables are prone to damage, from natural causes or accidents, and are difficult to maintance.", "The power lines in my neighborhood are buried. A few years ago I lost power, and the power company told me that one of my lines had broken due to the soil shifting over time.

I've seen others have their cars modded and say something like \"I'm running +3 degrees of timing.\" or something like that. What exactly happens to the engine when you run more or less timing? Edit: grammar\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["There are two type of timing: ignition timing and valve timing. When you see someone talking about adding/subtracting a few degrees, they're probably talking about ignition timing. Ignition timing is when the spark plugs fire in relation to the position of the piston. Getting it right is a balance between igniting at the highest compression (closest to Top Dead Center for the piston) and making sure the spark has enough time to ignite the air/fuel mixture. Getting closer to TDC will increase power, but advancing the timing can cause the spark to start so late that the fuel doesn't completely burn, causing a reduction of power and drivability issues. Since stock engines are usually tuned very cautiously, advancing the timing a little is generally a good way to get some extra power. Granted, there's WAY more to it than that (vacuum advance, ignition at different RPMs, computer controls, the effect of different manifolds, etc.) to really understand how to use timing to tune, but that would turn this into \"Explain Like I'm an Experienced Engine Builder.\""]}
{"prompt": "Why cant we build a bridge from Key West to Cuba?\nAn elaboration of the question: Regardless of either countries relationship status, would it even be possible to build such bridge? It would only be 90 miles or so?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["the longest bridges in history are usually built over relatively calm bodies of water. The challenge isn't how far we can build a bridge, its can we keep it safe/stable enough for cars to drive over it. The Depths of the Caribbean Sea are somewhat extreme, and for many miles of that distance, we are talking about over 1 mile of water. We can't very well put supports on that, so we'd be talking about a floating bridge... While the technology for building a floating bridge does exist, building one of that scale, in an area that is routinely plagued by the hurricanes that visit the region on a yearly basis would make it very implausible to construct, maintain and keep safe a bridge that spans such a very long distance. Also, as far as accidents go, people are stupid. One accident would back the bridge up for.... the entire bridge. 90 miles of traffic jam due to an accident would be unsolvable. You've also got to look at how many people would actually USE the bridge. Theres only about 5,000 registered vehicles in Cuba, and mainly the use would either be tourists or travellers. 90+ miles for businesses is more easily done with a plane-ride than in a truck due to sheer speed alone.

{"prompt": "how do plane formations (specifically jet display formations) keep their speeds identical for extended periods of time?\nAn elaboration of the question: Is it as simple as super-sensitive speedometers?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["This is a big part of my job. To directly answer your question, it's as simple as trying to drive the same speed as a car next to you on the highway. Add more gas if you're getting behind him, reduce it if you're getting ahead of him. You can do this on a bike or even walking next to a stranger. In jet formations, the leader of the formation tries to make it easy by keeping the same speed. As promised, a little more in depth... Flying in formation requires no instrumentation or advanced aircraft systems or computers. It breaks down into a few simple components. **1) Knowing where you want to be relative to the other plane.** In formation flying, the position you need to be in depends on what you're trying to accomplish. It can be arbitrary or have a specific purpose. You can try to be directly side-by-side, at an angle, behind and above/below... it's only limited by how easily you can see the other plane. As an example, the most common formation you will see is called parade. It's a tight formation that's used for things like flying together through low visibility, checking the other jet for damage, etc. [To fly perfect parade F-18 pilots have reference points.]( URL_0 ). For position, the pilot is trying to put the tip of the missile launcher rail of the jet he is following (in orange) on the headrest of that jet. The red line shows how they line up. For distance, he is trying to line up with the end of the exhaust nozzles (green line) For other formations, there are other reference points. For planes or positions without defined reference points, a pilot can use his own cockpit for reference, create ones when he gets close, or use intuition. **2) Recognizing when you aren't.** When things don't line up, it's pretty obvious. If, from your perspective, the tip of the launcher is in front of the headrest. You are behind, and need to move forward by \"moving\" the rail back. If the rail appears above the headrest, you are low, and need to pull up to \"move\" the rail down. A big part of this is seeing the movement before it gets too big. To be precise, corrections are made before the error becomes too big. **3) Knowing how to get from where you don't want to be to where you want to be.** This will totally answer how speeds can be matched between two planes. Let's use the above example. The tip of the rail is forward of the box. We need to move it back. [Reference this image]( URL_1 ) Add enough power to go a little bit faster than the other jet. Once the tip is about to touch the box, bring the power back JUST enough to stop the movement. If you've gone too far, you didn't catch it in time and need to add power to move the rail forward. Since you're never going to do it perfectly, the alignment will keep changing. With practice, you will only need little power movements to stop those alignment problems from getting too big.

{"prompt": "Why are old houses built better than new construction?\nAn elaboration of the question: I own a home built in the 30s and everything in it is solid. Every door is made of real wood and has some heft to it. I have beautiful real hardwood in every room. There are little character details everywhere like special trim and a built in bookcase with cool matching arches on the doorways. Note, I do not own this great mansion or anything. It is just a classic American Foursquare, a very typical middle-class house during the time it was built but it has all of these great qualities built in. One of my friends just bought a house from the 90s and everything feels...worse. Not that the house isn't nice, it probably cost a good deal more than mine and is much larger, but all the doors were very light and just looked cheap. No hard wood floors only laminate that looked like wood (but obviously not), tile, and cheap carpet throughout the house. There was also absolutely zero character or even design to the house, except some sky-lights in the kitchen which were admittedly kind of cool. Why are things that were built in the first half of the 20th century seemingly much better than what came after? Or is the newer stuff actually better and I have no idea what I am talking about? This could be true, but it doesn't seem that way to me.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["You're not wrong, things were built better. Your house cost ~$7,900 in 1930s money, or $115k after inflation in current currency. But things were built differently, we didn't have the mass production we do today, companies didn't have the capability to minimize their product to the minimum acceptable while marking up their consumer price to the maximum the market would stand. We didn't have a disposable economy where everything is expected to be shit and you just throw it away. I remember way back in high school taking a few years of CAD and architecture (I'm so glad I didn't pursue it further), and we learned quite a bit about minimizing materials. Back in the day, a 2x4 was a lot closer to it's rough cut dimensions. Now days, they're typically actually 1-1/2\" x 3-1/2\" or less. Engineers are hard at work determining just how little is actually necessary to frame an acceptably sturdy and load bearing wall. Joists used to be 14\" OC, now they're 16\". And this much I can say for sure: cookie cutter new construction houses, built as starter homes for first time buyers, are designed by people who had never given any thought to actually living in that house themselves. They're designed to be both easy and cheap to manufacture, fast to erect, and have sale appeal. The living spaces typically aren't actually usable, but the model homes are staged perfectly, because their layout was designed by the architect at the beginning. This is how we were taught to design a house. As late as the 70s, all houses had hardwood floors. It's what you did. And THEN, they would cover it in carpet, because carpet back in the day was a lavish extravagance. Now days, they put carpet right over the subfloor (admittedly, it makes the most sense). Beams are undersized. I remember this. Even my instructors said if they architected their own house, they would upscale the size of their main support beams and use older standards to over-specify the construction of their floors and footings. You know how to test you have a shithole constructed house? Walk across the room, does the china hutch rattle? On the other side of the house? This whole subject just makes me angry. I've been looking at some new construction that starts even above my price range, and I see a brand new house, not even a year old, with substantial sheer cracking in the foundation, enough that this brand new house will need to have the crack sealed at the very least, and likely the foundation cut and replaced in 10 years. Concrete cracks, yes, it's supposed to, foundations settle. But this is bullshit. If you want a quality house, you're going to spend a lot of money to get it, and it's difficult to evaluate contractors for suckage.", "\"Better is in the eye of the beholder\" Compare an American door latch to a German door latch if you'd like a real shock. German door and window hardware feels like it will be completely serviceable in 100 years. Frankly it looks a lot like the 100 year old stuff in the older part of town. Folks aren't heading out to the Home Depot every few years to get a new door latch. Making things plentiful at lower initial cost while ignoring the life cycle cost implications is a hallmark of US marketing.", "Your house also may contain lead paint, lead pipes, asbestos insulation, lead pipes, wiring that would make an electrician weep, no central a/c ducting, etc so \"quality\" is subjective.

Cheap house, cheap material but expensive in todays dollars", "> everything feels...worse Totally subjective feeling. Lighter materials have their benefits, \"Cheaper\" options like laminate and cheap carpet aren't bad because who would want to finance fancy carpet for 30 years? Just upgrade the stuff you want.", "Some homes were built better back then, because the only people who could afford homes were more well off (pre-30 year mortgage), and because there was no minimum wage, lots of cheap immigrant labor. But there is also a confirmation bias at play... the only homes still standing 90 years later are the best built ones. For every well built, solid brick home from the 1920's there were also others that burned, fell apart, or were torn down for something more modern in its place.", "The pretense isn't really correct. Maybe new houses come with laminate floors, but they have better insulation, better framing, electrical systems, and such. When I worked for Hometime they remodeled a foursquare and found nice woodwork but shocking deficiencies in the framing. You can still commission a house with real wood floors and such if you want. In the old days cheaper finish materials weren't available and real wood and the labor to install them were cheaper. Oak is really expensive now, but it didn't used to be; my 1960s house has oak trim with cheap tile floors.", "In college I lived in a house that was built in the early 1900's (somewhere between the 20's and 40's in the Midwest). It is not that it was necessarily built better, but they did not have the same materials we have today. What you are seeing is known as survivor bias. Just like we say that \"Look at how all of these monuments/bridges/buildings lasts from the first millennium\", but you have no idea how many building were destroyed since then. By the 90's came around lots of construction developments have been made. One example is the pre-fabrication construction. Other things include door materials (the fiber board). Your friend probably got a base model house, while you got a house that, when it was new, was embellished. Houses now can be erected in a few weeks. Compared to a month or more of work. Each house will have their problems, but the older the house the more issues you are going to have with a variety problems. Cracking foundations, warping wood, and poor wiring are just a start. So your house will feel like it is more homely without as much furniture or decoration, but your friend's house will be more sound 'behind the scenes'.", "I do see homes with hardwood floors. Ours does, and it's not a high end home, but hardwood is popular in Boston suburbs. On the flip side, unless it's been upgraded or the builder was at the leading edge, that 1930s home probably has knob and tube wiring, or at most two wire wiring, with maybe one or two outlets per room, and a fuse box instead of circuit breakers, and maybe just 60 amp service. GFCI outlets would be an upgrade. The bathtub might not have had a shower originally. One thing people haven't mentioned is that labor was proportionately cheaper back then. Homes use sheetrock now because plaster skimcoats require more skill and labor. A good hardwood floor requires some expertise for the finish coat; laminate or prefinished hardwood is cheaper.", "This was a big deal when I was a volunteer firefighter in rural Ontario. The local area had a pretty big stretch from homes and shops built in the 30's and 40's, to new ones still going up. Partially it's the difference in the availability of materials and cost; such as readily available hardwood trees back in the day, that would be large and strong enough to span a roof, that just aren't around any more. I've seen center roof beams and floor joists that that are a single board, a foor thick in both directions. Modern construction replaced these with MDF board and manufactured wood I beams (think beaver puke). The other part is the engineering knowledge at the time. Back in the day, everything was over-engineered and oversized because the science and knowledge just wasn't there. Think about it the same way old cars and trucks were built, compared to modern ones. Bigger, heavier, more resources."]}
{"prompt": "How can bombs be unexploded?\nAn elaboration of the question: Recently saw an article about the Oxford-Cambridge boat race possibly being postponed because of an unexploded WW2 bomb. I was just wondering how bombs can land and not explode. Also how can bombs as old as these still be active and dangerous?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["WW2 bombs (like pretty much every bomb) require two parts - the ~~combustible~~ explosive material (what goes boom) and a fuse (what makes it go boom). The fuses were usually set based on the bombers height to make the bomb explode as close to the impact time as possible (so people couldn't run away). There are various ways that the fuses could be started - either when the bomb was dropped, when the bomb reached a certain speed (using fans in the nose) or trigger bombs (that would explode when contact was made) Sometimes these fuses would fail and the bomb would land but not explode. They can still be incredibly dangerous because the explosives in them are still active and if exposed to anything that would cause them to ignite will explode. The old trigger bombs are (obviously) the most dangerous because all they need is for somebody to hit the trigger (assuming it hasn't rusted over) and they can explode.", "As a further twist to fuse failure as already discussed, it was discovered during the Spanish civil war (pre-WWII) that bombs that did not explode due to fuse failure caused more disruption than the ones that did explode -- the area around the bomb would have to be evacuated until the bomb was rendered safe. The Germans then started installing fuses that had a long delay-time, hours or days even, to cause this sort of problem. An entire military specialty, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), was devoted to finding and de-fusing these bombs. Twist number two is that the Germans then engineered fuses that were specifically designed (booby-trapped) to explode and kill the EOD officer trying to de-fuse it. There is an excellent British mini-series about this WWII experience, DANGER UXB. Highly recommended. A movie on the same subject in the modern era is THE HURT LOCKER. [EDIT: spelling]", "Sometimes the mechanism just fails and there is no explosion, it's still dangerous because if the contents ignite the bomb will still explode."]}
{"prompt": "Why, if petrol is more volatile and burns hotter and faster, are diesel engines more efficient in engines of the same size?\nAn elaboration of the question: In Europe particularly, diesel cars are much more popular now than petrol. A new diesel 1.6 engine burns much less fuel than a 1.6 petrol, for example. How can this be when petrol is much more volatile? Surely if it explodes at the rate it does, petrol can generate more power? Petrol cars are faster, but so much less efficient comparably.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["As said before diesel fuel has more energy per volume, but that's not the whole story. The 'burn' in a diesel is more powerful not only because of the fuel type, but also because the compression ratio of a diesel engine is much higher than a gas engine on average. It's so high that a diesel engine does not use spark plugs to ignite the fuel mixture, the burn happens from the force of compression alone (except in startup situations and/or if you have a tricked engine management system where the 'glow plugs' are activated to aid the combustion process). Higher compression ratio typically gives you an increased volumetric efficiency and ergo yields more power output. Now all that said, these new direct injection gas engines are getting up there with relatively high c:r, but still not quite near a diesel yet.", "Diesel fuel contains more energy per unit volume than does gasoline.

{"prompt": "How does a fire cause a interstate highway to fall\nAn elaboration of the question: How did the fire lead the highway in Atlanta falling. Why does it look like such a clean spit?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The portion of the interstate that collapsed is made from precast concrete beams. A bunch of steel reinforcement bars (rebar) are shaped and welded into a beam and it's placed into a mold into which they pour the concrete. Those beams are then placed between structural supports and metal decking is placed between them. The concrete roadway or road bed is then poured on top of the metal decking. This is all made of material that contracts and expands with heat so at both ends there are expansion joints. In this case it's just a giant compressible rubber gasket that's about 4\" wide. Concrete is extremely strong when undergoing compressive forces but not so great when it's under a flexion load. The beams are cast in an arch so that when they are loaded(heavy stuff on top), the concrete is under a compressive load. The fire burned under the entire bridge and was hot enough to weaken the rebar. Think about the bridge like a long board that's supported by two chairs; one on either end. The roadway on top of the beams is \"really heavy\" and the weight is mostly evenly distributed among them. The weakened rebar caused the arch shape in the beams to deform enough to where the load on the concrete moved from compression to flexion. In the board analogy if you put enough weight on the middle of the board it'd sag. Keep adding weight and it'd deform enough to where the ends would slip off of the chairs. TL;DR The fire did NOT melt the steel; it just got it warm enough to where it was bendable. It bent enough to where the bridge beams slipped off of the supports on the ends"]}
{"prompt": "Would a refrigerator act like a heater if placed outside in subzero temperatures?\nAn elaboration of the question: If not, do they specifically design refrigerators to work in places such as Antarctica?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["A refrigerator would NOT act as a heater in sub-zero temperatures, it would simply turn off. The refrigerator has temperature sensors inside that turn it on and off based on the temperature inside, and normally what happens is the heat from outside seeps into the refrigerator, making it hot, and activating the temperature sensor. If it's cold outside, then the heat inside the refrigerator will seep out, and the refrigerator contents would get cold. Temperature sensor would detect this and turn off the refrigerator to conserve energy. In addition, the refrigerator transports the heat using a gas that turns to liquid at a certain temperature; because of the cold outside, this gas would stay liquid or even possibly freeze, and the refrigerator wouldn't function properly. For Antarctica, if they need a refrigerator inside a (normally warm) kitchen, they probably use a regular refrigerator. They're designed to work in normal temperatures that you find indoors. Or, they could have some outside storage sheds that would be very cold because of the environment, and thus use no electricity to freeze meat or whatever.", "Any sort of heat exchange machine always outputs a net surplus of heat because they consume energy to operate. A refrigerator operated in any environment will output heat. Refrigerators are not usually designed to work in places such as Antarctica because all the need is that the heat exchange coils on the outside of the refrigerator are warmer than the surrounding environment. It being too cold outside isn't really a problem in any way. Furthermore most consumer refrigerators dump heat from inside themselves into the room in which they reside. Even if in Antarctica if the room is a similar temperature to normal then the refrigerator doesn't care at all what the outside temperature is. Finally if it is super cold outside all the time people don't care about refrigerators, they just put things they want kept cold outside. Cooling things down isn't a problem when there is ice everywhere."]}
{"prompt": "Manual Cars\nAn elaboration of the question: Literally just explain what the clutch does to let the car change gear. And like how the gears move in and shit. Just explain a manual engine like I'm 5\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The rotation of the motor must be transmitted to the rotation of the wheels. What the clutch does is connect the rotation of the engine with the rotation of the wheels. Inside the car you have several gears with dog teeth connected to one another [like this]( URL_0 ). The engine is rotating, makes the green (and inevitably the red and the blue) turn. But the blue are turning blind, they are not connected to the yellow rod. If your engine is off and you're rolling downhill, the yellow rod rotates, but all the gears are still. The yellow rod is only connected to the purple and it's what makes the wheels of your car turn. With the clutch and the knob you can move the purple and attach it to whatever you need. When the purple is attached, you have a direct connection between the engine and the yellow rod (and eventually, the wheels). The reverse has an additional gear, so the rotation of the engine is transmitted backwards to the wheels. And gears work in the same way as in a bike. You can pedal a lot (high rpm, but get not a lot of displacement for all the pedaling you're putting in) or pedal less and make the engine (you) more effective. Now, on a bike you usually choose to be less tired (pedal a lot) at the end of the day. But in a car you're looking for the most effective and less fuel consuming gear."]}
{"prompt": "How does data recovery from formatted SD cards work?\nAn elaboration of the question: Like if I formatted an 8GB SD card which had, say, 5GBs of data, then the computer shows me that's I now have 7GBs of free space. Then where is the previous data stored such that it can be recovered? And if it can be recovered from the 1GB of space(which means it can fit in 1GB space and didn't really require the 5GBs of space) then why wasn't it stored in just 1GB rather than 5GBs to begin with?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The difference between an 8GB card vs a 7GB card has to do with how cards are marketed vs how computers count data. It's kind of fucked up that it's allowed, but it's the way all data storage is sold. A card retailed for 8gb contains 8,000,000,000 bytes. Except computers don't count in base 10, they count in base 8. So 8 GB in computer talk is 8,589,934,592 bytes. This is stupid, but it's the way storage has been sold since forever, so that's just the way it is. 8,000,000,000 bytes is around 7.4 gigabytes. You might also lose a little because there's some overhead. So that takes care of your missing space. The recoverable data is not in that space. So the way computers store files are in 1 looooooong string is 1's and 0s. The computer then makes an index that says FileX starts at position 362 and runs to 492. So it makes note of where it stores the file, what storage positions the file occupies. So when you delete a file, all that happens is it removes that file from the index and notes those areas as \"available\". It does NOT actually go back and change the 1 or 0s to some other value. It just kind of abandoned the file and notes the area as empty when it's really not. When you want to store a file in that so-called \"empty\" space the computer just over rights whatever is there with the new data and makes a note in the index. File recovery ignores the index and goes directly to where the storage is, it looks at all the 1s and 0s and try's to identify what is actually stored there, as opposed to what the file index table says is there. So if the table says positions 1 to 10 are empty, the recovery program looks at 1 to 10 and finds that there's actually a picture stored in 7 & 8, 1-4 are a video. 5 & 6 are part of a video and 8 & 9 are part of a picture."]}

I feel like when hauling long distances, you'd want to be as aerodynamic as possible to save on fuel costs.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["In the US trucks used for long haul work usually are pretty streamlined. They need that large flat grille to suck air into the radiator during the summer, but the rest of the cab angles back. Some companies even put fins on the bottom and back of the trailers to disrupt vortex formation and lower drag. Trucks that do more local hauling don't usually go fast enough to warrant any aerodynamic improvement, so other concerns like cost, maintenance accessibility, and length determine the shape.", "I'll add that the tractors in Europe are boxy (flat in front, with the cabin above the motor, not behind like the typical American truck) because of length restrictions covering the whole vehicle, instead of only the trailer.", "They are designing more aerodynamic truck portions, but the trailer portion will be either box or open topped due to the nature of the semi trucking industry.

{"prompt": "What's the difference between a well optimized computer program, and one that's not well optimized?\nAn elaboration of the question: I'm a Computer Science Major, but still a Freshman in College. (Within C++) I've recently learned about \"pass by reference\" in relation to \"pass by value\", and it got me thinking... Passing by reference (even when not modifying the variable) makes it so no extra copy is made of that variable, thus making the program require less memory to run. Is it little things like this, when done thousands of times, that makes a program well optimized? I'm very curious. Will someone smarter than I please enlighten me?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Pass by reference vs. pass by value is one of the many optimizations that people consider when looking to improve performance when using C variants where this functionality is exposed. In other, higher level languages, this functionality is performed by the compiler and therefore isn't exposed. Instead, when people discuss optimization they are usually referring to how a task is being done and whether it makes sense. Loops are expensive, especially over large data sets so a lot of optimization revolves are minimizing the number of times you have to perform that loop or figuring out a way to segment the data so that each loop is smaller. Optimization may refer to how data is organized either in memory or in the database to limit the amount of information that needs to be passed around or worked on.' And then there is really low level optimization where you may opt to implement a piece of functionality in software on a FPGA or custom built chip instead of in software on commodity hardware. It all depends on what level you're working at and what your most expensive operations are."]}
{"prompt": "Are diesel cars better or worse for the environment than petrol cars?\nAn elaboration of the question: As I understand it, diesel is worse for the local environment as they cause more air pollution. So if all the cars in your city use diesel, you will have lower air quality than if all the cars in your city used petrol. On the other hand, diesel cars have better mileage than petrol and so contribute less to climate change. Netting these two factors, are diesel cars greener than petrol ones?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["It is an ongoing debate whether diesel or gasoline causes more pollution. Diesels often seem to cause more pollution, as they release more of the visible pollutants, like NOx and soot. However, they release fewer hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, things you can't see as easily. They also don't release lead, which is less of concern in places that mandate unleaded gasoline.", "It depends on what you're looking at. If you're just taking the engine into account, and nothing else, Diesels are considerably cleaner. Spark Ignition vehicles typically operate in such a way that they have an immense amount of partial combustion, which produces all sorts of hydrocarbon compounds (which are typically both bad for you *and* the environment), as well as carbon monoxide. Diesels, on the other hand, generally burn pretty cleanly, because they generally operate with spare oxygen in the cylinder (if they're not, you're literally shoving fuel out of the exhaust). **However**, there are two major caveats. First, it's actually surprisingly easy to clean the exhaust from Spark Ignition engines. We use catalytic materials to actually promote this cleaning process, and those catalytic materials generally perform better when they have all sorts of chemical species to work with (particularly, hydrocarbons). Normally, this wouldn't be a big deal until we get to the second problem. Diesels have what is called the NOx-PM tradeoff, whereby every diesel will either make particulate matter (PM), which is basically just fuel droplets that didn't burn completely and are shoved out the exhaust, or oxides of nitrogen (which are, collectively, NOx), which are some of the worst compound to come out of your engine that aren't the hilariously bad things like BTEX compounds. The tradeoff exists because you can't really run the engine without producing one or the other without getting into particularly interesting engine cycles that are kind of difficult to control. PM we can sort of deal with, but you generally don't want to be making PM (as you're literally just shoving fuel, and therefore money, out the tailpipe), so we generally end up making NOx instead. The big issue with this is that NOx is **really** hard to clean up in diesels. There are various convoluted methods to do so (the gold-standard of which is Selective Catalytic Reduction, or SCR, which typically requires urea injection). Note that Spark Ignition engines will *also* produce NOx, but the same dirty exhaust helps in cleaning that NOx out through normal catalysis. In diesels, the exhaust is extremely clean already, so we can't take that path. So, as for which one is better...Diesels. Diesels are far more efficient, in that you'll get more energy per liter of greenhouse gases emitted by the engine, but they make NOx and PM. Both NOx and PM can be cleaned, but that makes the engine more expensive upfront, and can eat into the cost savings from having lower fuel consumption. If you're okay with the added costs, then diesels are considerably cleaner. FWIW, what VW did was try to use the tests to justify their deletion of their SCR systems, which costed a significant amount of money, and thus forced them to raise the prices, which in turn hurt sales. The specifics of how they did their cheat are actually hilariously easy to pull off, such that I wouldn't be surprised at all if most of the other diesel manufacturers in the US and the EU hadn't at least considered attempting it.

{"prompt": "How do civil engineers ensure the on-ramps and overpasses supported by manmade dirt slopes never collapse?\nAn elaboration of the question: I've always been curious how these last without issue. Is the dirt just packed really hard, or is there more to it?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["A pile of granular materials has a property known as \"angle of repose\" which is the angle the side slopes of a pile of that material spills to when left alone. Embankment sideslopes are designed at an angle less than this angle of repose to keep the sideslopes stable. Secondly, the material is compressed, this tends to lock the edges of the grains together and it also tends to remove voids. Remove the voids prevents water from running between grains which could destabilise them. Compacted earth is often also vibrated as it compacted so that the grains move around and fit together better - as an experiment, try gently shaking a coffee jar, and you'll see the level of the coffee drop as the grains fit together better.", "They are not generally supported by dirt slopes.

{"prompt": "Why do cars tick when they're hot after stopping?\nAn elaboration of the question: I have noticed that cars, particularly more modern sports cars, tend to make a ticking noise when cooling down after being driven hard. Is this due to the cooling system itself or just a byproduct of the engine being hot?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["My understanding is that it is the hot parts on the car expand and contract based on how hot they are. So as the parts cool and shrink a bit they move ever so slightly and make a small noise. Alot of the time it tends to come from the exhaust system as it changes temperature the quickly and is made of fairly thin metal, so it works like a bell when any small thing changes. Think of a house creaking at night when the temperature drops. Additionally, depending on the engine it can be cause by the block and heads being different metals that expand and contract at different rates.

As for why, it mostly comes down to bad luck. Japan is simply not blessed with good sources of iron (that's part of why they were so hard up to invade China before and during World War II). Traditional Japanese swordsmithing used iron sand, and with the smelting technology of the day that produces a very impure and comparatively low-quality steel. The folding and hammering that goes into making a traditional sword was partially to counteract the poor-quality materials. As for Chinese steel, that's really the same as Chinese products in general being cheap and low-quality. Apparently manufacturers sometimes try to pass off low-quality metal as prime steel. There's nothing really special about China in that respect; it's just that right now they're the foremost producer of cheap stuff. 50 years ago Japan was in the same boat, ironically. 150 years ago it was Germany.", "\"Additives in some Chinese steel used to reinforce concrete can affect the metal’s strength when it is welded and now UK industry is highlighting the dangers posed by it. Chinese steel makers sometimes add boron to their products to get a tax rebate as it was classed as an alloy. When the steel joined by arc welding, boron can make welds more likely to crack, weakening structures. The risk comes from current regulations not requiring steel-makers to specify how much boron has been added if the steel is used for reinforced bar – or rebar – which is added to concrete to strengthen it. If steel contains additives, different welding techniques have to be used so eliminate the risk of cracking.\" Source: URL_0", "I think you are mixing two things: Katanas were made of Tamahagane which was a kind of steel made from iron sand (satetsu) which was not a very good iron ore to begin with so the result was a somewhat impure heterogeneous steel. Nowadays the steel companies are not necessarily (mostly not) the ones that extract and/ refine the iron. The process of making a good steel is something that has to do not only with a proper mixing of ingredients but also with the treatment of the resulting material in different stages of cooling. This is because steel is actually a crystalline material. This crystals can very in size and length. In order to make a resistant steel u need to produce long shaped crystals so that it is harder to brake when bent. This knowledge is not necessarily sheared by big steel companies that also have been doing this for centuries in some cases. So that's why Asian steel can be of less quality nowadays. EDIT: a typo"]}

{"prompt": "when you flush a toilet, how does the water get sucked? Is it by a vacuum or the just the additional water that is added\nAn elaboration of the question: I'm asking in regards to conventional toilets not airplanes\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Conventional toilets work on water being added from above. The force of the water rushing in and then pouring over the top of the S-bend sucks the contents of the bowl out. When the flush cycle completes, the toilet trickle-fills the bowl a bit more in order to wash the sides of the bowl and fill the S-bend to the point that an air seal is created to keep the smell out. Conventional toilets do **not** work on siphons. If this were the case, when one toilet in the house flushed, all of them would, because they are all connected to a common sewer stack. In reality, the stack is vented to the outside above the rooftops to allow pressure to equalize, preventing one flush from causing a cascade. **TL;DR:** Toilets flush from the action of the water surging into the bowl and over the S-bend. No vacuum, suction, or siphon is involved, as sewer systems are not designed for that. **Edit: I've been corrected by people more knowledgable in plumbing. There is a siphon involved, but only through the S-bend.**", "Depends on the toilet. Nearly all flush toilets have piping that goes like a un shape, with the bowl at the top of the u and the drain out the bottom of the n. The bottom of the u is filled with water, the top of the n and the drain is air. In the 'washdown' design it is just the force of the water falling down from the tank that flushes. It makes the water level rise in the u, go over the top of the n, and flow away. The water level won't change much when you flush. This design is the norm in Europe. In the 'siphon' design part of the pipe is narrowed and the water rushes in. This makes the water level in the bowl rise rapidly while the water moves into the pipe more slowly and totally fills it. The water level in the pipe goes round the top of the n and this starts a siphon, pulling the water round and out of the bowl. Only once the water in the bowl drops to the bottom of the U can air get in and break the siphon. This design is the norm in North America. And yes, it's a siphon. It doesn't affect the rest of the toilets because the siphoning water flow is only in the pipework for that toilet, with air further down the drains. There are some other designs, but those are the main ones. EDIT: To be clear. A difference is that in the washdown design, the top of the un bend is always an air space even during the flush. In the siphonic design it fills completely with water when it flushes."]}

When the engine is about to stall, depress the clutch. If you don't want to keep your foot on the clutch, you can choose to put the car in neutral and then release it. An alternative technique is to shift down through each gear as you're braking. That was used more with older cars that didn't have such good brakes, shifting down meant the engine could help slow the car. With modern cars most drivers don't bother. EDIT: And in fact organisations that teach driving, for both new learners and 'advanced' driver training, favour the 'block shifting' method where you brake down to your new speed then change into the gear for that speed. For example doing 70 mph in 6th gear, brake to 30 mph, then select 4th gear.", "The wear you put on a vehicle by holding the clutch down completely is negligible.

{"prompt": "Valves in engine\nAn elaboration of the question: When car manuf. say things like hey look my gt500 has a 32 valve engine, what does that mean?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Engines have intake valves and exhaust valves. The intake valves open as the piston is traveling down during the \"Intake stroke\" to allow air (and fuel in some cases) to enter the combustion chamber, then the valves close. The piston then travels back up and compresses the air (and fuel in some cases) during the \"Compression stroke\". The fuel is added at this point (if it hasn't been already) and it either ignites (diesel) or is ignited by a spark plug (gasoline) and the resulting explosion forces the piston back down during the \"Power stroke\". Finally, the exhaust valves open and the piston travels up to expel the spent combustion byproducts during the \"Exhaust stroke\". This process is repeated thousands of times per minute and produces the rotational force to the transmission or transaxle and moves the vehicle. Someone discovered along the way that more valves is usually better to an extent. Two smaller valves will flow better than one larger valve, and things usually fit better that way as well. So when you hear about a 32-valve engine, it means that each of the eight cylinders has two intake and two exhaust valves. There is a lot more to this, but this is the best simplified answer I could come up with. Also, the four stages of a four stroke engine are sometimes referred to as suck, squeeze, bang, blow."]}

{"prompt": "Why is it recommended to have an odd/prime number of stators in each stage in a jet engine?\nAn elaboration of the question: According to several sources in the design of high-efficiency turbomachinery and gas turbines, when designing the blades and rotors, it is common to use an even number of rotors for balancing reasons, and an odd (\"preferably prime\") number of stators. This \"preferably prime\" statement is found in different sources. As far as I can tell it is for mechanical vibration reduction and minimizing resonances. Can anyone explain why an odd number, and why prime numbers?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Imagine one rotor blade passing by a sequence of stators. As it passes by each stator there's some change in pressure. That change in pressure will be similar for each stator it passes by. On its own that rotor blade gets some vibration with a frequency equal to the frequency at which it passes by stators. Exactly what that vibration looks like isn't important, just that it exists and is based on the frequency of passing by stators. Now imagine that you have exactly as many rotor blades as you do stators. Every single one of the blades will be at the exact same point in their vibration at the same time. If, for example, the blades are pushed forward when the rotor and stator are aligned then the entire rotor is being pushed forward all at once. Now imagine that you have exactly 1/2 as many rotor blades as there are stators. Once again you have exactly the same problem: every rotor is lining up at the same time. You could do the same with 2/3 as many blades, but now the blades line up in groups. If you have N rotor blades and M stator blades and you reduce the fraction N/M as far as you can to n/m then you'll have n groups of rotor blades that are experiencing the same vibration at the same time. The goal is to make n as large as possible. At best n = N. One way to guarantee that n = N is if N is prime. A less restrictive way of making that that guarantee is to make sure that N and M are coprime (i.e. there is no number greater than 1 that both are divisible by), and a simple way of approximating that for relatively small numbers is to make N odd and M even (or vice versa)."]}

{"prompt": "Why do commercial buildings have flat roofs while residential buildings have sloped ones?\nAn elaboration of the question: Maybe this is unique to the city I'm in, but pretty much all houses have sloped roofs - because you want the snow or rain to slide off it. Makes sense. But pretty much all commercial buildings I see - ranging from 40 story sky scrapers to a single story convenience store - pretty much all have flat roofs, The buildings are built pretty much entirely with 90 degree angles. Why is this? I can kinda see skyscrapers because I understand how concentrating the rainwater and letting it fall 40 stories might cause *problems* but you get all these commercial buildings, schools, some small apartment complexes that are only one or two stories tall, and they all have flat roofs.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The slope of something is defined as the height divided by the width. A roof needs to be at least a certain slope for snow to slide off of it (rain generally will slide off a gentle slope). This slope is easy to make if the roof is small. However, if the roof is commercial sized (large width) and you want the same steepness throughout, you will end up with a VERY TALL slopped roof (large height). It's just not feasible. Secondly, the amount of material needed to cover a flat roof is less than for a sloped roof (the flat side of a rectangle is always smaller than the diagonal). When you need to cover a lot of roof area in commercial buildings, price becomes a factor. Next, a flat roof allows you to put things on there. Air conditioners and other ventilation systems are much larger for commercial buildings compared to smaller ones and generally they are placed on the roof. These would be very difficult to install on a sloped roof. Lastly, depending on the weather, a flat roof is fine. If it doesn't rain or snow much a flat roof will do. A sloped roof just looks more pleasing on a house (and it can add attic space) so residential houses have them simply to increase property value.", "So there could be several reasons, I can think of 3 off the top of my head. 1: Residential buildings have attics for storage. 2: Having an attic allows for more insulation, since a house has to be heated pretty much 24/7, while a school only really needs to be heated 8-12 hours a day. 3: As a home owner it's easier to replace a patch of shingles or even replace all your shingles in the event your house had some damage. But a flat roof requires a thick and heavy layer of tar to seal it from water damage. This usually needs special equipment and professional insulation."]}
{"prompt": "How do manufacturers make artificial flavors taste almost exactly like the real thing!?\nAn elaboration of the question: For example: How do they get grape flavored soda with 0 calories, 0 sugar? How do they match all these different flavors?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["**TL;DR**: *They usually concentrate on including a very special family of chemicals called 'esters' that are at the core of the flavour they're trying to duplicate, and top it up with sweeteners that are so low in calories they can legally market them as having zero.* Flavours are caused by a mix of chemicals that affect two of your senses (let's ignore stuff like texture, as 'crunch' or 'chewy' is not a flavour.) There's stuff that affects your taste and that your tongue picks up, like salt or sugar. And there's stuff that you smell and that your nasal passages pick up, like the smell of food cooking or that freshly cut pear. Both of them combined are released when you bite and chew, and that's why a good steak tastes stronger it smells. *(**Sidebar eli5**: when you have a cold and your nasal passages are all frigged up, you lose this second sense and that's why food is often more tasteless when you're ill.)* You usually only need a small trace of the latter type of nose-friendly chemical to influence the flavour of food, and certain chemicals are really strongly associated with certain foods. These are often 'esters', a complex chemical that our nose picks up and we know is quite distinctive. Bananas have one ester, oranges another, and some fruits like strawberries have a bunch that give a new smell when combined. Duplicate that chemical or mix in the lab, or get even close to it (for example, by using orange squash to flavour orange soda), and you have your flavour. Because only traces are required to make a food taste like a pineapple, they have essentially zero calories until you start adding sugars and other stuff to make it \"tongue friendly too\". And by adding artificial sweeteners or natural stronger sweeteners like Stevia that have a lot less calories than sugar, you can keep the calorie count so low that it's okay legally to say \"this product has 0 calories\".", "A chemical is a chemical. The source of it doesn't make it \"real\" or \"not real\". If there was a good tasting plant that derived its flavor from a complex of Fluorine, Uranium, Carbon, and Potassium, it would be no different than making that same complex in a chemical factory."]}

But how does that work on something like an iPhone torch. How does the circuitry 'open the flow'? Does something move inside? What moves that?! Cheers everyone\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["There are electrical components called transistors that can be used as switch or amplifiers. A transistor has three terminals, applying a voltage or current at one terminal (called the base or gate depending on the type of transistor) controls the amount of current flowing through the other two terminals (call the drain and source or collector and emitter depending on the type). There are other components that can act as switches. Relays are an example. They use an electromagnet to attract a piece of metal and close a circuit. SCRs (silicon controlled rectifiers) are similar to transistors except that they latch on and stay on until the voltage through them drops below a threshold value. Thyristors are similar to SCRs, except that they work with AC. Vacuum tubes can also be used as switches, but they're obsolete for most applications."]}
{"prompt": "How does an automatic transmission work?\nAn elaboration of the question: Also, why are automatics considered to be more complex and costly to work on?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Manual transmissions are quite basic. You have an input shaft with gears on it that turns and an output shaft with different sized gears on it and clutches to select which one you want to change the gear ratio. Stuff can be spaced out and there are limited parts In an automatic transmission you have planetary gear. There is a large gear in the middle (sun gear), a big ring gear(ring) on the outside, and smaller gears(planets) that connect the ring to the sun. Gear ratios are changed by choosing which gear is the input, which is output, and which is locked in place. All of these gears are packed together and a modern automatic could have up to 4 sets of planetary gears resulting in lots of parts, all of which are covered in oil. Transmissions have a rather low rate of problems and a rather high skill requirement to properly fix which results in there being few shops being willing or able to work on them which drives up the price", "I think this question is better answered by watching a youtube video explaining all the basics."]}
{"prompt": "Do heat-seeking missiles ever accidentally lock onto the sun?\nAn elaboration of the question: I don't know how they exactly work - but do they recognize the sun as a hot object?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Usually, a heat-seeking missile has been programmed to change its trajectory based on various things, and so it can usually tell if it's detecting the sun (or, for example, infrared light from the sun scattered off of clouds) or if it's detecting its actual intended target. Compared to a person or a vehicle, the sun outputs a very obvious signal in infrared, since it's pretty much always going to be the same level of infrared light and in the same shape, provided it isn't getting partially obscured by things. If a missile simply ignores the brightest source of infrared light (or, if it's searching for super-heated jet engine outputs, ignores anything less bright than that) if it appears to be the size and intensity of the sun, it wouldn't be tricked by the sun. Of course, it isn't always going to be perfect, and there are conditions where the missile will mistake various things for its target - clouds, heat from sandy ground, and so on. Better and better technology and imaging techniques helps to mitigate this. The most sophisticated heat-seeking missiles basically make an infrared image of the surroundings and analyze it. Of course, even that isn't going to be perfect, yet. That's why we use \"identify the pictures that have signs in them!\" as ways to prove you're not a robot - computers are pretty bad at correctly interpreting visual data.", "Yes, this is actually a known problem with primitive heat-seeking missiles, and pilots would occasionally try to get between the missile and the sun in order to transfer the missile's focus onto the sun. Modern missiles are specifically programmed to avoid this."]}
{"prompt": "What exactly does a land surveyor do?\nAn elaboration of the question: Also, how does their equipment, such as the tripod/telescope-looking thing, help them do it?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["They make sure facts on paper agree with facts on the ground. If you want to build a fence, you want to make sure it is on your side of the property line, otherwise your neighbor can tear it down if they like. You call a surveyor, they will review the property records, and so you exactly where the line is. Or maybe you are building a new shopping complex. You bought the land, you have decided where to put all the buildings, roads, and parking lots, and now you need someone to take those plans and put stakes in the ground so the builders build in the right place. The equipment lets them do this. The property records/building plans will reference some known landmark or coordinates. The surveyor starts there, sites their instrument in the correct direction, then measures off a certain number of feet, according to whatever they are working off of. Eventually, the set markers in all the key locations so the next people to come along know where everything belongs.", "Land surveyors measure and record where things are on the surface of the earth. Usually in relation to a known geodetic grid. They also layout for new construction, such as roads, buildings, and even parking lots. As a former instrument operator, the instrument is usually called a total station, and it performs many tasks, such as measuring angles, elevation, as well as distance. The more common instruments can collect data, but that is usually done on a handled unit almost like a scientific calculator with special programming and memory that allows points to be stored, calculated, and even uploaded for laying out on the ground. Once a given point on the earth is known, the surveyor can then follow calculated angles and distances to get where they need to be to layout whatever it is they are tasked to do that day. Sometimes it is just about recording where something is, so that the civil engineers know where it is and are able to incorporate that into whatever they are working on. Things like houses, fences, curb and gutters, streets, utilities, drainage inlets and outlets, as well as any other permanent structures that can't be moved.

{"prompt": "Why are pistol bullets usually wider than rifle bullets?\nAn elaboration of the question: A smaller Pistol caliber is 9mm. While a larger size rifle caliber is only 7.62mm. Why is that?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Bullets have both length and width that contribute to their volume, and therefore weight and power. In a rifle, the magazine can generally be whatever dimensions are convenient for the designer to make them. For a handgun however, the magazine goes inside the grip, and so must fit within a human hand. This restricts the forward-to-back dimension of the cartridge so that pistol bullets need to be short and stubbier than rifle bullets to fit. In order for the bullets to stay big, they just make them wider to compensate. On another point, because the case, and therefore powder volume of a rifle is so much larger, rifle bullets tend to go close to 3x as fast as a handgun bullet. Even so, at the extreme ranges that a rifle is used, the bullets can fall over 3 feet, making it important to keep that velocity up. Lower bullet mass and narrower bullets help with that. Since a handgun is so much more difficult to shoot accurately, its not really important that it's terribly effective past a few tens of meters. Thirdly, since the bullets move slower, (this is a little controversial) it has fewer mechanisms for wounding. Rifle bullets will send a shockwave through flesh, damaging organs even far away from the wound channel. Handgun bullets are slow enough that they don't really do that. In order for an organ to get damaged by a handgun bullet, the bullet has to actually pass through it. Making the bullet wider increases this chance. TL;DR Handgun bullets need to be short to fit in the grip, they are slow because they don't need range, and they are wide so that they still have adequate wounding potential at low energy.", "With a rifle's intended long range, bullet speed is important -- and a heavy but slow-moving bullet may not reach its distant target. So they use a moderate-weight bullet with a relatively large explosive charge. Rifles using a large bullet, then, require a *very* large explosive charge, making them harder to handle and heavier. Also, pistols don't have a lot of length in the chamber simply because they are compact, so a wider rather than longer bullet is the way to add mass."]}

You need to log into a certain service once in a while or something happens. You find those not only in movies, but also in your homebanking or many other sites. If you are not active for a certain amount of minutes/days/weeks, you are automatically logged off. Snowden might have one of those. 3. Social. Either you need to call a person once in a while or, in the case of Snowden, that person basically watches the news or follows you elsewise and if nothing happens for a certain amount of time, something happens. Snowden might have one of those. I expect that Snowden actually has several of 3, it might be people he trusts or pre-paid lawyers in possibly different countries, instructed to become active should he get killed, arrested or simply vanish.

{"prompt": "Nuclear Fusion Reactors\nAn elaboration of the question: Reading about the nuclear fusion reactor in the UK .

Edit 1: thank you for all the great answers! Okay, so I can understand that it's not actually touching anything, but then wouldn't the heat generated by the plasma still be cause for concern? I understand that this heat is where we are getting the energy, but then if we're constantly pulling it, wouldn't that drastically reduce the temperature of the plasma?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The part of the reactor that is 100 million degrees Celsius is plasma (the state of matter past air) and it is contained in a magnetic field. The magnetic field keeps the plasma from touching anything, which means it can only heat things up through radiating heat, which is a slow way to transfer heat (though at 100 million degrees it would transfer heat very fast even through radiation). Why this won't melt the reactor is how the reactor generates energy. Basically you flow a lot of water around the reactor to cool it off. The water boils into steam which turns a turbine. The turbine generates electricity. Now in the actual reactor they aren't using water, but a mineral salt that melts.", "This is the reason why the reactors do not have any material close to the fusion material. The reactor core is suspended in vacuum by magnets and will slowly release its energy to the surrounding cooling pipes in a controlled manner. The problem people are facing when designing these reactors is that either the core produce too much energy for the system to dissipate though power generation or there is not enough energy being produced to give a net gain in power generation. So people are working on slowing down the reaction rate so the energy can be safely harvested and power the strong lasers and magnets required to get the ignition to start. There is a proposal that have been out for quite a few years to build a massive fusion reactor from known technology. There are however a few problems. It would take the entire US government annual budget to construct one reactor, the power grid is not big enough to handle the output and the power requirements is not high enough to be able to use all the power. To solve the two last problems there are some well known chemical processes that use CO2 and converts it into oil using power. The problem is that these processes are very inefficient and you would typically only get 1% of the energy back. The reactor would still be able to produce more oil then Saudi Arabia even with the massive loss in efficiency."]}

Number of Cylinders: More cylinders means more explosions per second (higher pitch) being pushed out the tailpipe. That V12 Ferrari has a lot more cylinders firing per revolution at idle, then my 4 cylinder does. Layout: Depending on the type of engine, the layout of the cylinders will dictate different needs for the exhaust system. Essential, the air being moved away from the cylinders starts in individual pipes. These pipes need to join up in some way into one pipe and go out the exhaust. Depending on how the firing of the cylinders is timed, and how long each pipe is before they all join up, means that you might not be hearing the firing of each cylinder as it really happens.

That steam rises through turbines who spin magnets in in an electrical field like the inside of a roll of copper wire. That creates the electrical current.", "Some people have done a good job of this but left out a couple important parts. A turbine is used to spin a rotor (think of something like a long axle) that is connected to the generator which actually spins the magnets in a copper field which creates the electricity. Historically these turbines have been mostly steam powered, where a power producer will burn something like coal, trash, or even byproducts of oil; use the heat from the burning to create steam. The steam runs through a series of blades attached to the rotor which spins the generator Present day, a lot electricity is created as part of a combined cycle. A combined cycle starts with a combustion turbine (oftentimes Natural Gas). A combustion turbine will take a fuel (NG) and compress it, burn it, and use the resultant heat escaping to push blades on a rotor, which is attached to a generator. The exhaust from 1-3 natural gas turbines then heats up steam which will power a steam turbine. *Apolitical commentary coming* This is largely why coal jobs are disappearing and likely won't ever come back. Natural Gas is easier/cheaper to extract from the ground, burns much more cleanly, and creates energy more efficiently due to the combined cycle. *Fun trivia* Everyone in the power industry pronounces the word 'turbine' as (ter-bihn) not (ter-bine). The word comes from the french word turbinem (ter-bihn-um), which meant swirling or spinning water, and eventually the /m/ fell off, leaving the word we use today.", "The hot water produces steam, which spins a turbine. This turbine is essentially identical to the alternator in a car, albeit at a much larger scale. It contains a stator, which is a stationary set of electrical conductors wound in tight coils around an iron core; and a rotor; a magnet that spins around the stator. By spinning the magnet around the coil, electricity is generated via the law of electromagnetic induction. In short, the moving magnetic field induces electrical current in the coil, which creates AC power.", "_Everything_ has electrons. \"Electricity\" is what happens when we force those electrons to _move_ by literally pushing them with magnets. So for your literal 5 year old, I'd suggest going to a pet store and looking at one of those trapped-ball cat toys. The ball is always there, but it just sits there until someone pushes it along. So a generator is a loop (well, many loops) of wire and a strong magnet (well many magnets). By moving the wire or the magnet (depending on the design, in modern generators we tend to move the wire loops) the magnet pushes the electrons in the wire. In \"AC\" -- \"Alternating Current\" -- the pushing is back-and-forth. The direction of the push alternates, because the magnets and loops are arranged to go from magnetic-north (which pushes in one direction) to magnetic-south (which pushes in the other) and then back again. Now since magnets push electrons, it turns out that electrons push back on magnets. This is that whole \"equal and opposite forces\" thing. So the electricity in a loop of wire from the power plant to my house and back is like a bicycle chain of electrons. Each electron pushes its neighbor just like the links of the chain move each other. So you move the pedals and the tire turns. (It's actually like having that captured ball toy being full of balls since only \"pushing\" happens, but from here on out I'll be using the chain to stand in for the crowded ball toy.) A motor in your house is like a generator. So much like a generator that in many uses they are interchangeable. When the power plant turns its generator the chain-of-electrons moves the motor in your house. But if that motor doesn't want to turn it pushes back and factually tries to slow the generator at the power plant. So like the bicycle chain, it's harder to pedal up hill because the wheel pushes back on the chain which pushes back on the pedals which makes your legs have to work harder. Same deal with generators. So who or what is doing the pedaling? Well we use falling water in dams; or we boil water with coal, oil, gas, or nuclear heat; or we use wind pushing against blades in windmills. As long as something is on the other end turning the pedals the electricity flows. This is also why turning things off saves energy. When things are off they are not pushing back, so its easier to turn the generator, which in turn means it takes less water, heat, or wind to keep things running. So one last side-thing about solar... Clearly there is no magnet nor is there anything spinning around, so WTF amirite? You know that thing when you are on a bike and you push the pedal a little then ratchet back then push the pedal again? You never turn the pedals all the way around but you keep adding just a little force then click back then add a little force? That's how solar panels work. Photons (packets of light) are very like electrons. They can push electrons around and create momentary \"electromagnetic\" forces as they arrive. And diodes and such can act like ratchets, where they only let the electrons move in one direction. Solar panels are just giant diodes. The electrons can only easily move from the front (sun-facing) side to the back side. The photons from the sun shove the electrons to the back of the panel. The only way they can get back to the front is by going the long way around through the wire. This produces a single-direction, non-alternating current, called a \"direct current\" or \"DC\". Just like a battery produces DC. So the force of any one photon moving any one electron is tiny... so the panels are made quite large and they work best in strong light. Just massive numbers of tiny events ratcheting electrons along one at a time. In the end, electrons push and get pushed. You find something that can push, be it photons or steam or falling water. You give it something to push against, like a turbine. You hook that to a magnet/coil deal so that the pushing translates from physical shove to electrical shove, and you pipe that shove into your house by using wires where it can shove motors. Or shove photons (LEDs) directly. Or shove its way through difficult wires, causing heat because the electrons are bumping into things (your electric fire, stove, etc). Or shove through thin wires that are also resisting the shove creating so much heat that that everything glows white hot (old fashioned light bulbs)."]}
{"prompt": "How does a gaming AI enemy work? How does it know to attack you or your friend in co-op?\nAn elaboration of the question: I know there is such a thing as Aggro or some technical term like that. But in co-op it should be more than that, right? AI enemies do their own calculation right? So I want to know how do they work. Before I get someone saying \"Google it!\", I rather ask the community to learn different live opinions. Thanks y'all in advance for your comments.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["It really depends on the game. Computers are dumb. They can't make decisions on their own, and can only follow instructions that were given to them. A very simple AI in a shooter might have instructions that say: If the player is visible and in range, shoot at the player. Otherwise, walk along a patrol route. This is a \"conditional statement.\" The computer checks to see if the condition (player is in range) is true. If it is, an action (shoot at the player) is performed. If it isn't, another action (walk) occurs. You can add complexity by expanding the set of conditions that the AI reacts to, and providing actions. For example: If health is below 30%, find cover. Otherwise, if an enemy is visible and in range, shoot at the enemy. Otherwise, if the player is visible and out of range, run toward the player. Otherwise, if a nearby teammate is in combat, run toward the teammate. Otherwise, if a sound is heard, move toward the source of the sound. Otherwise, walk along a patrol route. The conditions are checked in order, and if any one of them is true, that behavior happens and the rest of the conditions are ignored. Conditions might also be nested inside of each other. You can add even further complexity by randomizing the behavior. Maybe each enemy has a \"bravery\" attribute that affects how much health they have to lose before seeking cover. Each enemy can also have its own method of selecting a target among multiple options. This can be either random or deterministic. A lot of MMOs are based on a \"threat\" mechanic, which calculates which player the enemy perceives as most dangerous. Others might attack whichever player is nearest. But finding a target is just another set of conditions. The more conditions you give an AI, the more complex its behavior can become."]}

One of the problems with cruise control is that it can't see the road ahead. So, the car will change gears on sudden inclines or declines too late and will, therefore, use more fuel - because of inefficient gearing.", "What saves fuel is not as much a matter if constant speed, but constant RPMs. Because it is rare to find a perfectly flat road, often the engine with have to change it's RPMs to maintain the constant speed. Higher RPMs will mean more fuel used.", "Overall I think cruise control improves fuel economy for most vehicles and driving conditions. Human drivers tend to change speed and drive inconsistently, thereby reducing fuel economy. On an incline and decline however, cruise control may cost you some gas."]}

It's caused by the wheels of cars bouncing on the road gradually moving the gravel, sand, or even clay around.", "They don't have a \"purpose\". It's how the road wears. When the gravel road is first laid down (or regraveled), the grooves aren't there. They form over time as the road wears. Why the road wears in that pattern I cannot tell you for certain. I suspect that it is due to the grader blade catching and jumping a bit as the road was first made. But I don't really know.", "Its washboarding, like tsuuga said. Its caused by vehicles either bouncing on uneven rock or spinning their tires on loose gravel. Water accumulation from rain on a gravel road that isn't properly crowned can lead to improper drainage and water sitting on the surface and washing out the fines (very small rock/sand) that helps to bind the bigger rocks together, which can also lead to more bumps or potholes. Then it just compounds on itself, as more vehicles travel over one of these bad spots, it will lead to vehicles bouncing or spinning tires more and more and more loose rock and bigger holes and it will just keep increasing the problem exponentially (not really that fast, but almost). Gravel roads will never stay perfect, no matter how well they are designed and compacted, eventually someone will spin a tire and everything will just go downhill from there. They require regular maintenance (grading and sometimes compacting), depending on how much use the road sees, and if its regular cars, or loaded log trucks. Its cheaper to build a gravel road and maintain it for low volume travel than it is to build a paved road. Forest engineer here, I design and layout logging roads (gravel roads) for a living. I also used to maintain these roads with heavy equipment (grader operator). Any other questions, let me know"]}

Are you asking why radio instead of x-rays or infrared?", "> Why are radio waves preferred for long distance communication? They aren't. The preferred method is trans-continental fiber-optic cable. At $50-400m (not including launch insurance or the cost of the launch itself), 288 strand fiber is cheaper per mile at ~$6/ft than a satellite, it doesn't suffer from interference, the signals are extremely difficult to intercept, since it's terrestrial it's relatively easily maintained, and latency is much shorter. Satellites have a typical theoretical maximum bandwidth of 155 Mbps, but in practice they get much less than that, whereas single mode fiber can achieve 10 Gbps per strand, and multi-mode is regarded as effectively near limitless at distances less than 100m. DWDM can achieve up to 16 Tbps, or more bandwidth on a single fiber than all operational communications satellites. Microwaves are used for point to point communication between two towers, using directional horns or parabolas, and have some specific application, enough that you still see them in use often enough, I suppose. From personal experience, I can tell you you're not supposed to stand in front of a horn because you can get yourself cooked from the inside out at those radio frequencies and amplitudes. For broadcast public radio, certain frequency bands have desirable propagation properties that make them cheap to operate and achieve wide coverage. Radio is typically the preferred method of communication when you don't have access to a physical line. A single satellite can provide line of sight coverage as far as to the horizon of it's purview from it's orbit. Antenna towers are preferred to be as high as possible for a similar reason, line of sight coverage. Different frequencies have different propagation characteristics. It's not an arbitrary decision that WiFi is in the 2.4 GHz band, those frequencies at typically 100 mW will scatter and be absorbed within a few hundred feet, perfect for local area coverage. These properties have helped dictate aspects of FCC regulation regarding things like tower height, maximum output, and frequency allocations."]}

I've also seen multiple apartment homes built recently and noticed that a a good chunk of the building is wooden, despite being many, many stories tall.

Explain like I'm 5, just how it looks like so little wood can hold so much weight and won't collapse while I'm sleeping at night.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Civil engineer here. There are two parts to this: 1. There has been a shift in the way things are designed over time. When we started building things centuries ago, we didn't quite understand material properties, so we over designed our structures i.e. we put in extra to make sure it would stand up. That's part of the reason many ancient structures are still standing, they are far stronger than they need to be. As we have tested and learnt more about materials, we are able to design structures closer to what they need for their purpose. This was mostly driven by cost during recession periods, where work was more competitive, so being able to build the same structure with less material meant you could bid a lower price on the job, so you were more likely to get selected. 2. For wood in particular, we have always known it is strong (100ft redwoods for example), but the problem has been knowing how strong a particular piece of wood is. For concrete or steel, you can try a particular method of manufacture, test the product to destruction, and know with reasonable certainty that if you use the same method again you will get a product of a certain strength. Wood is grown, so every tree will be slightly different, so when we used wood before, we over designed to make sure it was strong enough. Then we developed glulam, or laminated sheets of wood that were glued together to form​ structural members. This allowed for more certainty in the strength, therefore we can design wooden structures more efficiently. TL;DR - cost pushed us to design more efficient buildings, and wood was made more reliable by gluing sheets of it together instead of just cutting trees to the required shape."]}

Block buildings are some of the *worst* construction in earthquake-prone areas. This has been a serious problem in several disasters in third world areas. They can be reinforced well enough to be acceptable, but in many cases that means building a double-wall with framing as a separate reinforcing layer, making it not really a pure block construction at all.

{"prompt": "Why Moore's Law works, and why it will stop being applicable in ~2020\nAn elaboration of the question: What I'm most confused about is that it says computer power increases because of the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles every two years. But isn't this a physical thing? Aren't we constructing them smaller? If it will stop in 2020 because it's impossible to make transistors more compact at that point, why couldn't we have constructed them that way from the start? It sounds like more of a machinery thing than a processing power thing.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Gordon Moore of Intel gave an interview in 1965. He made the observation that the number of components per processor had been doubling about every 24 months. Over time, the doubling rate actually turned out to be about every 18 months. In practice, as the number of transistors per IC doubled, so did the density. Smaller transistors can switch faster. More transistors means you can do more stuff. One interesting thing is that people have been saying Moore's Law will be over since the 70s. Continuing to shrink the dimensions of transistors has been expensive and has required enormous technological development. Many limits that people thought were fundamental have been worked around. However, right now we're approaching the point where transistors would have to become smaller than atoms. That's pretty much impossible. So the next evolution will have to be based on a new device that's fundamentally different from the silicon transistors we know now. In order to fully understand the issues, you have to know a bit about how integrated circuits are made. The ELI5 version is that they're made in a photographic process that involves shining light through a patterned plate onto a piece of silicon. Generally, the smallest image you can clearly see (or pattern) using light is limited to about half the wavelength. Visible light has wavelengths around 400-700 nanometers. Early transistors were hundreds of times larger than the wavelength used to pattern them. As transistors were made smaller, dust particles became large enough to disrupt the patterns. People invented filtration technologies and moved IC fabrication into clean rooms. Eventually transistor sizes starting getting close to the wavelengths of light. The industry started using single-wavelength sources for better resolution. The industry moved from 436 nm to 405 nm to 365 nm.. and so on. Short-wavelength light sources are harder to make with sufficient intensity. In the 1990s the industry was using 248 nm excimer lasers (not cheap!). Then they moved to 193 nm lasers. All the while, the industry found ways to \"cheat\" and make features even smaller than half the wavelength. Some tricks they developed: - Modifying the chemistry of the photo-sensitive materials used to pattern the chips. - Using oil or water in between the lenses used to focus the light and the chip surfaces to make a small lens behave like a bigger lens. - Optimizing the patterning mask geometries - Exposing the patterns in multiple steps The industry has been stuck at using 193 nm lasers. Using all the various tricks, they can currently pattern features around 20 nanometers. It's got to the point where they're making devices about as small as they can be made with out moving to smaller wavelengths. The problem is that below 193 nm, most materials absorb light very strongly, so they'll have to move from using lenses to using mirrors to focus the light. Also, making bright enough light sources has been very difficult and still hasn't been perfected yet. The industry is expected to eventually move to using extreme ultraviolet, or EUV (~14nm wavelength). To keep improving performance, Intel and others have started introducing enhanced transistor designs. Until recently transistors in CPUs were basically planar. Now, they're moving to 3D designs that can switch more efficiently. The reason we haven't done all these things from the start is that we didn't know how in some cases and that many of the technological developments have been extremely costly. We've known how to make 20-nm transistors for at least a decade using electron beams instead of light. The problem is that process is still way too slow to ever be used in production. Developing to the state of the art we have today has probably cost in the trillions of dollars or more by this point. A single EUV exposure tool is expected to run 100 million dollars when it becomes commercially available. That's 20X more expensive than a state-of-the-art tool 20 years ago. So, in short, it's a combination of economics, technological limitations, and physics.", "Moore's law is just a rule of thumb, really. Transistors are *so damn tiny* right now that we have to invent new technology at every single step to get them any smaller. There's no way we could have made them that small back in the 60's. For one thing, we lacked computers powerful enough to design the very transistors they needed to run. The ultimate end of Moore's law is not our ability, but rather the laws of physics themselves. With transistors and wires that small, there is a nonzero chance that electrons will quantum tunnel out of their wires and into nearby wires, and suddenly 2+2 gives you 8 and computers can't work. You cannot make a computer smaller than that."]}

{"prompt": "why can't we eliminate traffic jams on major highways?\nAn elaboration of the question: It doesn't make since to me, with all of our advancements in technology, that we can't eliminate traffic jams. I mean everyone knows there will be heavy traffic at certain times everyday and we can predict it like clockwork. So why can't we fix it? Have we just decided as a society that a certain level of traffic stoppage is acceptable? Why can't they just build a couple additional lanes or anticipate the traffic and build them bigger to begin with?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Okay, I'm an engineering student (aerospace/mechanical), but I do a lot of studying of it on the side. Let me tell you, this is something I'm passionate about. & nbsp; **There are are few things that cause traffic on highways: (And this is the tl;dr)** * Merging * Number of Lanes (see merging) * Amount of bypasses * Backroad availability * Car spacing & nbsp; & nbsp; Let's look at **merging**. In my opinion, this is by far the biggest issue. I live in Orlando, and if you have been here recently, we are expanding I-4 to contain - I believe - six lanes on each side. This is a *horrible* idea. It is a two-dimensional idea; if there are too many cars on the road, building more lanes will allow them to flow better, yes? Well, no... not exactly. The reason behind this is merging. The biggest causes of *any* car accident is either: merging, rear-ending (touching that later), and backing up. The latter is almost completely irrelevant to highway flow. One thing to understand about merging is that sometimes it's caused by construction (adding irony to the I-4 project). Another is lack of oversight. Sometimes - and I'll use Altomonte Springs as an example (fellow Orlandians relate) - a highway is built, and is not imagined to expect a surge in traffic in the near future. With Altomonte, there is an exit with a major intersection (St. Rd. 436) that funnels an endless amount of cars. With people traveling from Lake Mary, DeBary, Sanford, etc, and all the thru-traffic being added with a never ending funneling of cars, a bottleneck occurs quickly. So adding more lanes does not help. [Adam Conover explains this well in his show]( URL_3 ) (Can't find a clip of the show unfortunately). & nbsp; The way to fix this would be to funnel traffic in a proper pattern with the **right number of lanes**. [Here is an example]( URL_8 ) (sorry for simplicity) that I made showing how traffic could be fixed. Similar to a **HOV lane**, but instead it's designed for *thru-traffic*. This is traffic that is either trying to go through most - if not all - of an entire city whether the commute is on the opposite side of town, or the driver is on a road-trip. This allows minimal stopping for people exiting. Now, the second half is the *exiting bypass*, and this allows people who need to - let's say - get off between Exit's 83-86 near downtown, people don't have to stop for people merging. The goal is to funnel people into as few lanes as possible. If you've ever seen a river, as long as water doesn't get squeezed into a small funnel-shape, then it will flow smoothly no matter how wide. If people don't merge, this stops a lot of accidents and \"*Snakes*\" in the road if you will. & nbsp; The next is **bypass** ability. Even with my idea, there will be back-up without sufficient bypasses for people who are not driving *straight through* the city. Let's say you're trying to get from Deltona to Titusville. Titusville is located Southeast of Deltona, so instead of driving through a city, and then *merging* into lanes to go east, it's easier to go the *hypotenuse* route, which is usually a *loop*. Thing is here in Florida, we have nothing but [freaking tolls!]( URL_6 ) Everything in yellow are bottleneck roads with traffic lights and businesses. The only *free* way through is down I-4. This adds to the stress. Believe me, [Atlanta]( URL_2 ), [New York]( URL_5 ), and [Los Angeles]( URL_0 ) are no picnic either. This asks a major question, how efficient are bypasses? Well, they too need to change design, because they can become worse than the main interstate through the city; Atlanta how I hear you calling. & nbsp; **Back roads** are key to alleviating traffic. In Kansas City, the highways have a tendency to backup quite horribly. But they clear in thirty to sixty minutes, while *so* many cities (Orlando) can have it last for almost three hours. The reason is the ability for people to get off when they need to. KC has a grid system as do many cities. It's not a gorgeous design, but it is most effective. People can get off the interstate early and hit a road that goes straight for dozens of miles, and on top of that, many neighborhoods have thru-roads. This is the complete opposite in Orlando. Only downtown has a grid. There are no guarantees that a road will continue in a straight manner for very long. Neighborhoods have *no freaking thru-roads*. This is mostly because of lakes. There's a ton of them around here. But with that, the city needs to find a way to go around and alleviate traffic. One bizarre manner looks like [this]( URL_7 ). We have a dozen or so of these bridges everywhere. Missouri is working on making highways more efficient and was the first state to implement [Diverging diamond interchanges]( URL_1 ) in Springfield, and almost every bridge they construct now over an interstate is of this design, and it eliminates left turns onto the interstate in intersections that don't have space for *cloverleaf* designs. It has proved to be very quick, efficient, and effective. & nbsp; The final thing to note is **spacing between cars**. When a bottleneck occurs and people brake, it causes others to do the same creating a \"*Snake*\" effect. I think [CGP Grey]( URL_4 ) explains it best in his video about how people need to maintain distance away from a car. Great story, once I was driving down I-4 to one of the theme parks, and of course there was a bottleneck. I decided to keep my car going slow, and I maintained 15 mph while the cars in front would go like 35 mph and then slam their brakes into a full ten second stop. But, that gave me room to maneuver while they waited and then started up again. What's better, is that the person behind me did the same thing and maintained a good two-hundred foot or so gap between our cars. And on top of that, no one saw the gap around my car and decided to zoom into the gap. In essence, **This other driver and I ended a freaking Orlando, FL bottleneck!** Regardless, the solution to traffic is long and complex, and this post only hits the tip of the iceberg. The contents of this post are a combination of my opinions, observations, and content I gathered from other media platforms. Take them as you will. If you got this far, you are either magical, or a reader who skips to the end. Either way, thanks. **EDIT:** grammar and stuff", "I'm not an engineer but I play one at work. Traffic jams are caused by one thing and one thing only: people slowing down. Adding more lanes does not actually reduce traffic jams because there are always \"pinch points\". That famous building next to the road? We can't tear it down to make more lanes so no matter how many lanes you build before you reach the building you are funneling people into fewer lanes to get around the famous building, which causes them to slow down. Picture a stop light. Everyone in line is stopped when the light turns green. What happens next? The first guy in line starts to go, and then a few second later the second guy goes, the a few seconds later the third guy goes. We now have lost capacity on the roadway because the guys later in line didn't start going at the same time as the first guy. depending on the number of cars at the light this could impact that travel lanes a mile behind the light as the further back you are from the light the later you start to accelerate.", "They have done math before to calculate traffic. They found out that a car cutting off a semi can make traffic up to 2 miles behind it come to a dead stop. URL_0", "I'm surprised no one's mentioned it yet, but sometimes adding lanes will increase traffic. If you merge on the highway on the right side and want/need to get over to the far left, the more lanes you cross, the longer it will take you, which also ties in to the second point: The number one cause for both traffic and accidents is *incompetent driving*. For an overly simplified example say you have x ppl in 1 lane spaced evenly apart. The 1st guy touches his breaks for no reason (happens outrageously often), the distance between him and the 2nd guy shrinks. 2nd guy touches the breaks but a little harder, to let the distance get back to what it used to be. 3rd guy does the same. Eventually 1 guy and everybody behind him come to a complete stop. This obsession with touching the pedals, breaking and accelerating over and over again will cause frequent total stops, aka rush hour traffic. I get really triggered when people with nothing in front of them, going exactly the speed limit, tap their fucking breaks for literally no reason. > _ <"]}

{"prompt": "Does cambering your car wheels actually have any benefit?\nAn elaboration of the question: I understand that the extreme camber that is the new fad probably doesn't do anything beneficial and most likely is counter productive. But is there a reason to camber your wheels more that required to keep them flat on the road?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["A tiny amount of negative camber helps during high speed turns where all the weight transfers to the outside wheels and the tyres deform by a degree or two. F1 cars typically run with 1, maybe 2 degrees of negative camber to keep the tyre wear from cornering more even (and hence last as long as possible before needing a pitstop).

If it's to far negative like in stanced vehicles, it becomes worse than having no camber at all.

{"prompt": "How is rocket fuel pumped into the combustion chamber of a rocket engine?\nAn elaboration of the question: The pressure in the combustion chamber is pushing out all exhaust gasses which make the rocket go up. So I assume the fuel has to be pushed into the combustion chamber even harder, so how is it done and how are the exhaust gasses prevent from entering the fuel tanks?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Your assumption is correct, and the various ways that propellant is supplied under pressure to a liquid-fuelled rocket are referred to as the different \"cycles\". Probably the simplest one is a pressure-fed rocket. With this cycle you have the propellant tanks pressurized to a higher pressure than the combustion chamber, by filling the empty space in the tank with a gas like helium, that itself comes from an even higher pressure tank. This works fine for small or low pressure rockets, but with larger rockets or high pressures, the propellant tanks have to be so strong that they become impractically heavy. Then you have the \"expander\" cycle, which uses a pump to pressurize the propellants. If one of your propellants is something like hydrogen, that boils at a convenient temperature, you tap off some of the liquid propellant coming out of the pump, use it to cool parts of the engine that need cooling anyway, which boils the propellant. You now have a supply of warm, high-pressure gas that you can use to run the pump and then just dump into an exhaust pipe afterwards. If that doesn't give you enough pump power, you can move up to a \"gas generator\" cycle. With this cycle you tap off some fuel and some oxidizer from the pump and burn them in a separate combustion chamber. This gives you a supply of very hot gas with a lot more energy in it than the expander cycle, so you can use it to run a much higher pressure pump. The exhaust is again dumped overboard or through an exhaust manifold in the rocket nozzle. Then you have the really complicated \"staged combustion\" engines, which are like the gas generator cycle except the propellants are not burned completely and are injected into the main combustion chamber of the engine. These can also supply a lot of pump power and you don't lose as much performance, as the exhaust from the pump still goes through the whole engine and provides some thrust rather than being \"wasted\". In case you're wondering how much power it takes to run the propellant pump for a large rocket engine: the pump for the F-1 engine used on the Saturn V rocket's first stage uses the gas generator cycle and produces about 55,000 horsepower of pump power.", "There's a [turbo pump]( URL_0 ). That's a fuel pump which is driven by a turbine, which itself runs on rocket fuel and oxidizer. Another way to do it is to pressurize the fuel tanks using compressed gas, so that the fuel is pushed into the combustion chamber by pressure. This makes the fuel tanks quite heavy though."]}

{"prompt": "Why electronics require such specific voltages as 3.3v, 5v or 12v?\nAn elaboration of the question: Is it just plain standardization? Why such numbers were chosen? How come we never see a household device requiring like 10v?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Two different things: Common batteries come in a multitude of 1.5 volt because a single cell of a alkaline battery provides 1.5 volts when full. This voltage does not change if the battery becomes bigger or smaller, that only changes the duration it can provide this 1.5 volt. The other, 3.3v, 5v and 12 volt (and you are missing -12 volt) are standardized voltage levels in electronics (and thus computers) and then specially transistors and all inherited technologies like digital chips: Digital chips (IC's, integrated circuits) specially the TTL series have an \"low\" or 0 level at between 0.0 and 0.8 volts and a \"high\" or 1 level between 2 and 5 volts. So the maximum voltage you need there is 5 volts. Bingo, there is your 5. -12 and +12 volt are (where?) the voltages used for communications, but early logic used +12 because of noise / interference. You needed a huge difference between a 0 and a 1. With the TTL logic later on this wasn't needed so much anymore and you could go back to 5 volts. Now 3.3 volt: It's part of making chips faster without melting. If you double the number of transistors on the same area and double the frequency, you will need four times the power consumption. That's a lot of heat. If you decrease the voltage for that chip, you will reduce the power consumption and the metal lines on your chip won't melt.", "It is standardization, but not necessarily by any organization. The reasons for the specific numbers are rather hard to pin down, but it makes sense that engineers settled on a few voltages as the most common. Early transistors worked best in the range of 12V, and that was the same as car batteries. Lots of parts like light bulbs, motors or relays are made to work at specific voltages, so there was a lot of incentive to settle on a few voltages. You don't see 10V often because it is so close to 12V that most engineers would just design for 12V instead. For a long time 5V was the main standard for digital circuits. This was probably due to the introduction of 7400 series TTL (transistor-transistor logic) ICs in the early '60s. Later CMOS parts (which are still widely used) were made to be compatible. The 3.3 and lower voltages are now often used because high speed circuits can switch faster with lower voltages."]}

In older buildings they do have a structural function. In these cases a brick wall isn't just one layer of bricks but several layers stacked and interlocked together. You can identify these because every few bricks in height you will see a row of \"thin\" bricks. These are bricks layed inward so that the outer layer will interlock with the next layer of bricks. The total height they can support is based partly on the thickness of the wall (something like a height of no more then 20 times the walls width at the base), though it's fairly rare to see a building of this type taller then 10 stories as it becomes increasingly more complicated to make a brick building taller without another supporting structure.", "We stopped making buildings out of brick or mostly brick a long time ago so I doubt they'd be structural in anything remotely modern, but they can absolutely be structural and there are plenty of buildings made entirely of brick.

{"prompt": "What are the major roadblocks to 'industrializing' spider silk?\nAn elaboration of the question: It seems to be the Holy grail of textile sciences, so why haven't we been able to create an agriculture around it like silk worm silk or synthesize it in a lab?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Unfortunately, spiders themselves cannot be used to create any decent amount of thread. For one thing, they are cannibalistic and like to eat each other when placed in close quarters. Also, the orb weaving spiders (the ones that create the strongest type of fiber) can create 7 different types of silk and only really one of them is useful as far as strength properties go, so you have to literally [incapacitate a spider and manually draw the silk]( URL_6 ) to get the correct fiber from them. And, even if you do that, you would need [over a million spiders]( URL_5 ) to create anything useful as around 30,000 of them are needed to create a single gram of spider silk. Not really scalable. Now, that being said, artificial and transgenic spider silks are being created and industrialized as we speak. There are many companies and universities that are developing it and are on the cusp of commercialization using various vectors to achieve spider silk production via genetic editing of various organisms. These vectors can produce 2 things directly: spider silk protein powder and spider silk threads. Each has advantages and disadvantages. The spider silk protein powder is created by genetically altered bacteria, yeast, and goats that produce the proteins in their milk. The goats are inefficient, producing only about 2 grams of protein powder per liter of milk. Also, the goats take a long time to breed, so expanding production with this method is very slow going. The bacteria is more efficient, but the preferred bacteria, E.coli, can't store very long gene sequences, so need to be truncated to produce slightly inferior proteins and need to grow in a vat to make enough protein to be usable. The yeast method is the best protein method as it uses yeasts like *Pichia pastoris* that are able to store and transfer longer gene segments efficiently and accurately. The yeast also will reproduce much more efficiently with much cheaper “fuel” (mainly sugar water) to create much higher quality proteins than the bacteria method. Both the bacteria and yeast method have a very short gestation time, so any gene “tweaks” can be done to vary the properties of the proteins for custom applications. After they get the protein powder, they can then mix it with other substances to change their properties, turn it into a foam or film, or spin it into a fiber. Unfortunately, the mechanical spinning techniques such as wet spinning and electrospinning are still lacking and cannot spin fibers strong enough to measure up to natural dragline spider silks, but they are still being developed and I think it is only a matter of time before this issue is overcame. The spider silk fibers can be directly created by genetically altering silkworms. These silkworms get various strains of spider DNA injected into them and they can naturally spin different types of fibers. This method allows them to create much stronger fibers than the protein method, but it takes a longer gestation time and a lot of mulberry and space to expand production. Also, since you are directly producing the fibers with this method, it would be more costly if you wanted to create foams or films that can be made with the protein method. Now for the major companies creating the silks: **[Bolt Threads]( URL_7 )** is a San Francisco based company using transgenic yeast to create proteins that they spin into fibers for textiles. They have already released a limited production of [spider silk ties]( URL_13 ) and are working with Patagonia to create more textiles from their silks down the road. **[Spiber]( URL_10 )** Is a Japan based company that uses bacteria to make their protein powder that they plan to use in [automobiles]( URL_2 ) and spin into textiles. They are working with Goldwin, the main producer for The North Face Japan, to create jacked called the [Moon Parka]( URL_4 ) that should hopefully be out this winter. **[Kraig Biocraft Laboratories]( URL_11 )** is a Michigan based company that uses transgenic silkworms to create spider silk threads directly. They are currently fulfilling a [contract with the army to create bulletproof material]( URL_9 ) at small scale and are hoping to open a [large scale sericulture facility in Vietnam]( URL_1 ) in the near future to start mass production of their fibers for use in textiles. **[AMSilk]( URL_8 )** is a German based company that uses transgenic E.coli to produce protein that currently is being used in [cosmetics]( URL_3 ) and can be used in [medical applications]( URL_12 ). They are also working with Adidas to produce a [spider silk sneaker]( URL_0 ) that should be out in the near future.

Also since water is more dense, turbulence and flow are a bigger concern so you need to be creative, like putting large cylindrical shrouds around them. All this makes them expensive, on top of having to be installed underwater.

Building turbines underwater factors in a bunch of new problems- you need to waterproof things, you need to prevent corrosion, it's a lot harder to perform repairs, it's harder to install, and you also need to put the cables to collect the power underwater as well, repeating all of the above problems. The turbines are also under greater strain and suffer more friction from water than air."]}

{"prompt": "Why hasn't the hydrogen engine taken over the combustible engine market?\nAn elaboration of the question: In middle school I was in a science fair and the kid across from me had a hydrogen engine prototype. He explained that it's a combustible engine that basically runs on water. So why haven't they taken over the market and afaik why haven't we made a way for it to run on salt water?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Hrm... okay, so lots of problems here. 1. Hydrogen engines do not run on water. They burn (oxidize) hydrogen in order to produce energy. Although the hydrogen can be extracted from water via electrolysis, most hydrogen is manufactured by breaking apart methane from natural gas. Even if the hydrogen burned came purely from electrolysis, you still need to provide energy to the electrolysis reaction in order to make that hydrogen. Said energy would come from power plants, coal, gas, nuclear, solar, whatever. 2. hydrogen is a gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. It is also invisible, undetectable to any human sense, and highly explosive. These all make it less than ideal for a fuel source. hydrogen needs to be liquified or highly compressed in order to have the energy density to drive a car more than a few miles. Now consider what would happen if two such cars were to collide. A canister of pressurized and highly explosive fluid is not what you want to have in your car in such a situation. The extra material that would be required to contain and protect the hydrogen would make a car much heavier than the plastic/sheet metal gas tanks in standard automobiles. And heavier = less efficient. 3. Those issues aside, hydrogen makes an appealing fuel because of its high efficiency. The combustion reaction of hydrogen and oxygen produces a lot of energy without requiring much to sustain itself. And since it doesn't produce CO2, it's appealing as a \"green\" technology (though it does produce NO2 and I think NO3 due to the nitrogen in the air, and those are both greenhouse gasses as well). The problem then comes down to efficiency. As I said, most commercial hydrogen is made from natural gas, because the amount of energy required to break down that gas compared to the energy that the released hydrogen produces is rather good (I recall reading somewhere that it's about 80-90% efficient? Don't have a source for that though). Generating hydrogen through electrolysis is much less efficient, somewhere in the 10-20% range. Using natural gas doesn't really help the environment. The carbon output shifts to the hydrogen processing facility, and you're spending more energy than just burning the natural gas in the car itself. Using electrolyzed hydrogen helps the environment only so long as the source of your electricity is much, much cleaner than the car (because you're spending so much more energy to liberate that hydrogen), but it's a massive spike in demand to the electrical grid. It's possible that hydrogen could replace gasoline in automobiles, but for now the cons outweigh the pros. Not to mention there's the logistical nightmare of installing new facilities in every gas station in the world to store and distribute hydrogen. Electric cars perform many similar functions, but have many fewer drawbacks, which is why they've been pursued more vehemently.", "> He explained that it's a combustible engine that basically runs on water Oh boy, it's this scam again. You can't run an engine on water, and the fact that it hasn't taken over the market should be the first clue. So in theory, you pass an electric current through water to break it into hydrogen and oxygen, burn those gases and get energy back. But functionally, you will **always** get back less energy then you put in to split the water in the first place. It's a thermodynamic certainty that you'll always be running at a loss. Now, hydrogen isn't a terrible fuel for combustion in and of itself, but pure hydrogen is exceedingly rare entirely *because* it's so good for combustion; it reacts very easily. Thus, you have to provide energy to split the water up and regain that hydrogen. Worse, burning hydrogen in an air-breathing engine isn't actually emission-free, because air contains nitrogen gas. At high temperatures (which hydrogen is very good at producing when combusted), oxygen and nitrogen react to for oxides of nitrogen (collectively, NOx), which are the emissions that VW recently got in trouble over.", "Hydrogen engines don't run on water, they run on hydrogen gas. Hydrogen can be sourced from water, but it's extremely energy intensive to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen is also difficult and dangerous to store in significant quantities (see: the Hindenburg disaster)"]}

You can put two of these cells in series (end to end like in a mag flashlight) to make 3 volts. An alkaline 9 volt is 6 small cells in series. Etc. Other materials such as lithium ion batteries make 3.6 volts per cell. Put two cells together to make 7.2v, 3 in series to make 10.8, etc. Use a regulator on those three cells to restrict the voltage to 9 volts down from 10.8 and you have a nine volt battery. So to answer your question, yes, a 9 volt battery is generally more than one cell in series. But how many cells to reach your desired voltage depends on the materials of the battery. Oh, and mAh is the capacity. One AA alkaline battery and one AAA alkaline battery will both have the same volts but the AA is bigger so it has more mah and will last longer. You increase capacity by connecting batteries in parallel, not series.

And are there speakers so clear you can't even differentiate if the instrument was playing right in front of you or not?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["There are speakers that can be put behind a curtain, and an orchestra put next on them, and most people wouldn't hear the difference. These setups cost as much as houses. There are speakers so precise they overdo it, giving away that they are speakers. There are several ways to measure a speaker's quality but there's only one that matters: listening to it. Speakers are like glasses, they sound different for everyone so only you know what you'll like. Short answer: yes, but it's not cheap", "There isn't really a unit of measure for accuracy. The closest measure we have is THD or total harmonic distortion. The less harmonic distortion in an amplifier and speaker, the more natural the sound will appear. For instance high THD in bass frequencies sounds boomy or bloated like a loud car stereo. High THD in treble frequencies sounds like an old radio turned up too loud or a megaphone. There are different aspects of amplifier and speaker design that can affect realism including dynamic range, noise, distortion, and frequency response. To produce an accurate sound it needs to clearly record the original performance, amplify it, and play it back without taking anything away or adding anything that wasn't in the original. For instance noise would be adding something to it. A recording that didn't cover the full spectrum of human hearing would be taking something away. Amplifiers are of different classes such as A, AB, D, etc. Class A is the closest to perfect reproduction but is very inefficient and creates a lot of heat. AB is pretty close but much more efficient. The differences are in the way the amplifier circuit takes a low level audio wave form and makes it louder. Speakers will usually use crossover networks to send different frequencies in a recording to speakers optimized for those sounds such as bass to a woofer, mid range to a smaller speaker, and treble to a tweeter. How well built the crossover is will affect the clarity of the sound as well as the tonal balance of bass to mids, to treble. The quality of the speaker and how stiff it is, how powerful the magnet is, the size of the voice coil, and it's dynamic resistance to the amplifier signal all affect the quality of sound and how loudly the speaker can play back a signal without distortion. In general a speaker cone needs to be very stiff. There is a type of problem on moving surfaces like a speaker cone called modal breakup. If you imagine the speaker as a flat piece of paper, ideally it should move up and down without bending the paper. But at certain frequencies, the paper will bend in different shapes like ripples on a pond. These cause distortion and color the sound. Speakers tend to be designed so the frequency at which this modal breakup occurs, is higher in frequency than the speaker will be played back at. For instance a woofer with a modal breakup at 100hz is fine if the crossover only sends it audio that is below 80hz. The frequency at which this happens changes with the stiffness of the speaker, the material it's made with, and the support structure and speaker size. To fully explore your question would require a 200 page book but these are some of the things to consider. The pursuit of realistic audio is generally the elimination of distortion and noise at every path in the signal from the original recording, through the recording medium like CD or Vinyl, through it's amplification, and it's playback from a speaker or headphone. A flat frequency response where the bass, midrange, and treble are in balance with each other, and how loud or silent a speaker can play back is in the same range of loudness as the original instrument. For instance drum sounds that when played back are as loud as a real drum, vocals that when played back are as loud as a singer in your room, etc."]}

{"prompt": "Why can't diesel electric trains go faster much faster than 130 mph?\nAn elaboration of the question: The fastest diesel-electric train tops out at around 140 mph and trains that routinely travel faster than 140 are all electric. Is this a mechanical limitation or a practical one? Could a diesel-electrical solve the speed problem by having a larger engine or multiple units? Could a petrol-electric or a gas-turbine engine propel a locomotive faster than 140 mph?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Diesel engines used for trains are very efficient, but they are very heavy. This is perfect for freight trains, which need a lot of weight on the locomotive in order to generate enough traction to pull the heavy train. High speed trains however are generally lightweight, so they don't need as much traction. But in order to accelerate quickly and reach a high speed, they need a lot more engine power than a freight train does. By making the engine lightweight, they can therefore reduce the amount of power needed to accelerate and maintain speed. So instead of a heavy diesel engine, they would need to use one closer to a car engine, which is less efficient. The French actually planned to make their TGV with a gas turbine, which would be very expensive to run with today's oil prices. It's also worth pointing out that the tracks that are used by high speed trains in Europe and Asia are almost completely electrified anyway, so it's by far the cheapest option. Even freight trains often use electric locomotives in Europe.", "Speeds above about 125 mph start to require exponentially more power.

Roundabouts reduced injury crashes by 75 percent at intersections where stop signs or signals were previously used for traffic control, according to a study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). This includes a 90% reduction in fatalities. *Speed* Roundabouts move traffic through an intersection more quickly, and with less congestion on approaching roads. Roundabouts promote a continuous flow of traffic since traffic is not required to stop – only yield – so the intersection can handle more traffic in the same amount of time. Studies by the IIHS of intersections in three states, including Washington, found that roundabouts contributed to an 89 percent reduction in delays and 56 percent reduction in vehicle stops. The only case where this occasionally fails is where the **difference** between peak flow and normal is very high. In this case traffic lights are used to assist the flow at the highest peak.

{"prompt": "Why did the Titanic's watertight compartments not have a watertight top?\nAn elaboration of the question: Every now and then I nerd out on engineering disasters. This week I got into the Titanic's sinking. I see that one of the prominent reasons it sank so fast is the \"transverse bulkheads\", walls that helped form its watertight compartments, were not watertight at the top and the \"top\" was not very far above the waterline. It seems to me incredibly stupid to call a compartment \"watertight\" if you know one side of it isn't watertight. But I also know when things look this stupid to me, I'm missing some vital piece of information that is key to making sense of the situation.

As long as the ship was buoyant enough to remain afloat with the weight of water in that compartment, and would not sink low enough for that water to flood over the watertight section into other sections, the buoyancy wouldn't be compromised. It's the same principle as an ordinary canoe. The top isn't watertight, yet the boat floats, because the water cannot rise above the edges of the canoe to flood the interior. The reason the Titanic sank so fast isn't because the compartments weren't watertight at the top, but because *so many* compartments were flooded by the massive gash (possibly also because the crew was slow to seal them, but I'd have to look that up to verify)."]}

Then circuit design teams to implement the block designs. Then various layout people to hand optimize what the automated tools create. And various other special functions. So when someone comes in and joins an existing team, they are usually working within a framework that's already started. They simply have to avoid putting forth ideas that they know are infringing. That's not a trivial thing, since it is virtually impossible to design a complex chip without infringing on *someone's* IP. You simply have to avoid the most recent, whiz-bang inventions or the critical ones that might incite another company to actually pursue litigation. Since everyone infringes on everyone else, most companies want to avoid lawsuits because they are an expensive, time-consuming mess that only makes lawyers rich. So if you don't infringe on anything too important it kinds of slides by. Usually."]}

How does this work?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["All pilots are required to know how to speak English, as are the people in the control tower. That way, everybody has a language they can all communicate in.", "As others have said, English is the international language of aviation, and there are some specific phrases that pilots are required to know in order to be able to communicate in English. However, there are two important pieces of information missing: - Not all airports use English. Some smaller airports which are mostly used by private hobby pilots use the local language. Some airports use a mix of English and the local language. Each country publishes a list of all the airports within the country, with a load of information about each airport, and one piece of information that's published is which language is spoken at each airport. For example, at many smaller French airports, air traffic control only work during normal working hours, but after air traffic control is closed, the airport still remains open but all communication is in French. This information is published to pilots by the French authorities. - Even when the language is English, some pilots and controllers insist on using the local language. There was an accident in France many years ago (sorry, I don't remember the details and don't have time to find them right now) where a factor in the accident was that the French pilot was speaking French to the French air traffic controller. The air traffic controller made a mistake and cleared a British aircraft to take off when the French aircraft was still on the runway. Had the British pilot been able to understand the communication between air traffic control and the French pilot, he probably would have realised the mistake and questioned the instruction to take off, but because he didn't understand what was going on with the other aircraft, he had no way of knowing the runway was occupied, and followed the air traffic controller's incorrect instruction to take off.", "There is a specific list of English phrases all pilots must know - called Aviation English.

{"prompt": "How do cubesats deployed from the ISS get into other orbits?\nAn elaboration of the question: I recently read that a lot of cubesats are now deployed from the ISS instead of piggy-bagging on a satellite launch. That left me wondering how they are moved out of the ISS orbit. As far as I know cubesats do not have propulsion systems on their own.

But that would leave the ISS orbit \"full\" of cubesats, creating difficulties for approaching crafts/the ISS itself.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["They use a robotic arm with an ejector system to launch the satellites into their orbits. This would mean that the two orbits would cross at one point, but the difference in speed, the different drag, and the fact that the ISS regularly boosts its orbit, means that the danger of a collision is miniscule."]}

There is also specification in term of sprinkler systems and evacuation. The problem is that a building is suppose to stay up for decades so a lot of building are not up to the current standard. The London Tower was built in 1974 for example. We can't either just ask everybody to follow the current standard because it would cost astonishing amount of money to do so. This would mean that some building would be simply abandoned because the owned couldn't pay for the renovation. An abandoned building would be even worst as a fire hazard. It would also not only affect big business, but also house owner. If you force everybody to follow the current standard, that mean home too. And the same thing would happen there, people without enough cash to renovate their home could lose everything.

Of course many aircraft, especially modern ones, are unpainted. With modern radar and infrared tracking and etc cammo designed to fool the human eye doesn't help much. Paint weighs the aircraft down and modern militaries have largely decided to dispense with the weight except for what's needed for various markings.

So the more distant objects we see the higher speed they have away from us. Which means they will be more red shifted. The problem is that some of the most interesting objects to look at is so far away that they go far into the infrared spectrum. The atmosphere is transparent to visible light but not to all infrared light. And similarly with the main mirror of Hubble which is better for infrared astronomy then earth based telescopes but is still not the best for this and have a relatively small diameter compared to modern telescopes. So the JWST is designed from ground up to be an infrared telescope which can see parts of the spectrum which is not visible though the atmosphere or with Hubble. And the main mirror is much larger then Hubble so it can collect more light and get better resolution images. So JWST is able to look at objects further away then we currently can and in a better resolution. The objects further away is very important to find out the structure of the universe since the light from these objects have been moving for a very long time. A lot of these objects are from the time when the earliest galaxies were formed or even before any galaxies existed. So being able to look at how our universe looked like not long after it was formed may help us understand how it was formed. There is also a secondary objective in observing rouge planets and brown/black dwarf stars in our galaxy. These are also emitting light in the infrared spectrum and can be very hard to observe using existing telescopes. But JWST might be able to observe them much better then Hubble."]}

{"prompt": "How is the maximum load of truss columns calculated?\nAn elaboration of the question: Those columns with many triangles inside of them, usually used to hold large structures. How much one of those things can hold in weight? They look very thin for the amount of weight they hold. Sure there are many sizes but I am thinking there is a correlation between the number of triangles and how strong it is.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The amount of load a column (whether part of a truss or not) can safely hold is principally based on the material,the geometry, and the nature of the load. The material (wood, steel, concrete, aluminum, masonry, plastic, etc) has a certain strength properties. Each material has a certain allowable stress (force per unit area) before failure (I.e. yielding, or permanent deformation). Also each material has stiffness properties, meaning the amount a material deflects with an applied load (called Young's modulus). This is important to know how something physically reacts under load, but more specifically is mainly used to establish buckling limits for a material, which is a different type of potential failure. The geometry is also important. For columns, the main variable is the cross sectional area of the component itself. Next is the length of the column. Next is the nature of the degree of restraint of the ends of the column (ends that are held rigidly are stronger to resist buckling than ends that are loosely held). Also of importance is the shape of the cross section of the column, the shape will dictate a property called the radius of gyration which will affect the amount of load a column can withstand before buckling. Also, the nature of the load is important to define. Loads can be applied in 6 different ways, axially (which is what I think you're wondering about), but also laterally in two directions (shear), and flexurally in three directions (bi-axial bending and torsion). All of these loads are combined to consider if the column is appropriate. Finally, most engineers use national design codes and standards given all the information above to establish the 'safe load'. As an aside, triangles are an important shape in structures (triangles in 2-dimensions, and tetrahedrons in 3-dimensions). These shapes efficiently transfer load by minimizing bending loads in a structure which will significantly reduce the strength of a component. Hence the more triangle in your structure the better. You had a good intuition regarding the presence of triangles."]}

Correct me if I'm wrong but a 6 piston engine has 0.66 liters of volume in each piston (4l/6pistons), and an 8 piston engine has 0.5 liters of volume in each piston (4/8).\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Credit to u/semaph0r3: Edit: Lots of people asking for ELI5 of ELI5, so here goes: Engines, like all engineering, is an exercise in compromises. You need to balance a whole bunch of factors to get a solution that meets the result. In engines, there's a whole bunch of factors, but for most purposes, you can focus on these: 1. An engine needs to make sufficient power to move the vehicle 2. An engine needs to balance out all the vibrations inherent in the spinning and shaking that's going on. If you don't manage this, eventually the engine shakes itself apart. 3. The engine needs to fit inside the vehicle (and, for performance applications, be located in a way that maximizes the handling characteristics of the car). 4. The engine needs to consume only so much fuel. A V8 engine handles all 4 of these in a nicely balanced way: its not really good at any one of the 4, but its 'good enough' to make it one of the best overall engine layouts. It also sounds sexy as hell. ----- The cylinder configuration of an engine has effects on two major factors, the smoothness / vibration, and the 'packaging' or sizing / shape / how it fits in the car. Cylinder count has nothing to do with power, typically - that has to do with displacement, flow of the heads, shape of the combustion chamber, cylinder pressure, compression, ignition timing, and a ton of other factors. Up until 2013, F1 used 2.4L engines that were V8s, a size commonly set up as an I4 in commercial vehicles. V8s come in two major flavors; flat plane and cross plane cranks, which describe how the pistons connect to the crankshaft. Cross plane V8s (where if you look edge-on the crankshaft looks like a cross) sit at a sweet spot of packaging - its only 4 cylinders deep so it can fit under hoods easily, but can pack a large engine displacement in a nicely sized cube while being vibrationally balanced. They do limit RPMs a bit though because of the cross plane balancing adds rotational mass, so high performance / racing V8s tend to go with flat plane cranks. V6s have even better packaging, but are unbalanced vibrationally, forcing a tradeoff of longevity vs power. Most commercial solutions favor the longevity side of the equation, so most people's perception of a V6 is an uninspiring motor. It doesn't have to be, but a V6 that outputs a ton of power is also an engine about to shake itself to bits. Inline 4s have excellent packaging as well but are also terribly balanced, often requiring an extra shaft to keep the engine even remotely smooth, so power output is very weak. But because of the small size they can still rev well, so they're used where engine efficiency is more important than broad performance. Inline 6s are better than V8s and basically every other engine at power delivery and smoothness (its why BMW uses them) but packaging them is really hard because they're very long and practically require rear wheel drive. If what you care about is performance of an engine and no other considerations, you want an inline 6 or its bigger brother, a v12 (which is two I6s working together, so butter smooth). Horizontally opposed engines (Subaru, Porsche) are balanced and have near perfect behavior internally, but are a total bitch to package. Subaru's understeer is a result of having to hang the engine really far out in front of the wheels to make room for AWD. Older Porsches have a reputation as Widow Makers due to the engine hanging far out the back of the car causing oversteer. Flat plane V8s have lower rotational mass so they rev higher and generally produce more power, but lose some of the V8 engine balancing. These are used in higher performance engines (Ferrari uses this layout, as well as the new Ford GT350) but require more maintenance and tend to have shorter effective lives. V10s are used in some applications and have some benefits, but its mostly a 'I have a bigger number than you' sort of thing. So why are V8s so popular? They're the 'poor man's performance' engine: cross plane V8s sit at a great intersection of balanced engine, packaging, and RPM potential. They're not great at all 3, mind: in fact, far from. But if what you're looking for is everyman's performance, cross plane V8 will fit in anything and deliver great performance, while not costing too much. There are some misconceptions that are common: low RPM torque is one of them. The V8 configuration has nothing to do with that - it has everything to do with the tuning of the engine with respect to camshaft profile and flow. Racing configured engines focueds on high RPM performance tend to have really poor low RPM performance, and small I4 engines can have lower RPM torgue with turbos or by camming them down, but their peak will then suffer as a result and be even more boring. The desirability of V8s in car culture has to do with the accessibility of power at the V8 configuration. Because of the factors above, the most big engine cars commercially made tend to stick with the V8 configuration due to its ease of packaging. Car culture then connected power to V8, even though that isn't the cause. Additionally, cross plane V8s have a sound that is very distinct and to my ears absolutely sexy, though the purr of an I6 or flat 6 is equally sexy to me as well. ---- A lot of other questions. Yeah, the VR6 is worth a mention, so are Wankels, as well as I5s. All really cool solutions to interesting problems. A lot of those things have been addressed but one thing wasn't: what actually determines whether or not an engine performs well? Think about a bike. You have the easiest time pushing on the pedal when it is rotated out at 90 degrees, so the pedal arm is parallel to the ground. Another example of this is its hardest to do the bicep curl when your arm is parallel - > gravity has the best lever on your muscle at that point. A piston is the same: the goal is to get the peak combustion pressure on the piston as its descending right around when the crank is rotated 90 degrees. The problem is the engine spins at a range of speeds, and so it takes different amounts of time for the flame to reach the piston. A ton of factors go into this, and its all about balancing these issues to get an engine to perform the way you need for that solution: A long stroke forces the flame to travel further, meaning its easier to get it to strike the piston head correctly at low engine speeds. At high engine speeds, the piston is moving away from the flame very fast and its hard to get it to reach peak pressure at the optimal time. A short stroke, wide bore has a shorter distance to travel so the flame front impacts the piston best at high speeds - at low speeds you need to hold ignition until really late. The more metal turning, the more force it takes to turn it. Reducing the amount of mass in rotation and the total surface area in contact allows more of the energy to be used for moving the vehicle, yielding fuel economy and power gains. If done improperly or over-zealously, removing mass will reduce the lifecycle of the engine. The engine needs to 'flow' well, or allow air in and out at the right times. The cycle of a cylinder happens really fast, and in that period of time all the air for combustion needs to get in, injected, compressed, and ignited. Getting that cylinder packed with as much air as possible allows more fuel to be dumped in, giving more power. Everything that moves needs to have a counter-movement somewhere else. This is to handle those vibrations. I can go on and on. I love engines.", "Hi there, assuming both engines are 4-cycle type, one difference is that the 8 cylinder engine will have 8 power cycles (8 power output pulses) per 2 rotations of the crank vs. 6 with the 6-cylinder engine. With all other things equal this would mean the power delivery is smoother. Luxury cars tend (especially in older days) have more cylinders to get the smoothest output possible - sometimes up to 16 cylinders! The torque curve (torque output vs. RPM) would likely be broader with the 8-cylinder engine again as it has more power pulses per rotation. So more cylinders for a given volume does have advantages, but also disadvantages - namely added complexity and cost. Adding 2 more cylinders doesn't sound like a lot, but that's more crank to spin, 2 more connecting rods and pistons, at least 2 more injectors, these days 2 more ignition coils etc. So if you are a car company you might stick with lower cylinder count to get costs down, and potentially have better reliability with the reduction in complexity.", "The answer is the surface area to volume ratio. When you make lots of smaller cylinders versus fewer large ones, you are creating more surface area per given volume. This has the effect of more effective cylinder aspiration per capacity and rpm, which means youre spending less energy in getting air in and out, so more power heads out the crankshaft instead. Another big advantage is that smaller cylinders have higher rev limits. It is (a little bit) easier to make power by spinning faster over other methods like forced induction.", "Think of it like a rowboat, where each person rows one after the other. One boat has 6 stronger guys rowing, and the other has 8 weaker guys. But their combined strength is equal. So if you're pulling something heavy, fewer stronger guys is better. If you are pulling something light and want to accelerate quickly, then more rowers is better.", "For what it's worth, a 4.0L V8 will be able to rev higher than a 4.0L V6. That's because the per piston displacement is lower on the V8, in this case, 0.5L/piston, and the V6 would come in at 0.66L/piston. What this means is the V8 will have a smaller bore/smaller piston and a smaller stroke. This means less rotating mass and, with the shorter stroke, less movement of the piston. This means this specific 4.0L V8 would be able to rev higher without stressing the crankshaft and connecting rods. The balance (as others have mentioned) is an added perk. You'll see this come into play: for example, Porsche used a 4.5L V8 in the Cayenne introduced back in the early 2000s. General Motors (Pontiac) had a 3.8 L V6. Even though the Porsche is a larger motor, they were able to get the engine to redline at 6,500 RPM, whereas General Motors accomplished only 6,000 RPM out of their V6. There are some other considerations that play into that outcome, but the displacement of each cylinder is no small part of that difference.", "The reason that engines with more cylinders, all other things being equal, traditionally make more power than engines with fewer cylinders (and a little less torque, and all at higher engine-speeds) is that engines with smaller pistons and shorter strokes (so engines of equal displacement but with more cylinders) can go faster, and so process more fuel, and so produce more power, for the same overall displacement. This is for three reasons: 1. engines with smaller cylinders have lower reciprocating mass in each cylinder, so they deal with smaller forces reversing the direction of travel of the piston / con-rod / crankshaft / valves at a given speed (in rpms) 2. engines with smaller cylinders tend to have shorter strokes, so the maximum practical velocity of a piston is reached at a higher engine speed. 3. engines with smaller cylinders can burn a fuel charge faster, since the flame inside the cylinder does not have to travel as far.", "Bore (how wide each cylinder is) and stroke (how tall the height of the piston travel) determine the size of the cylinder. Bigger cylinders have higher volume to surface area, ideally leading to lower weight than smaller cylinders, but also taller stroke so the piston can't travel as quickly, leading to lower RPM. I think most sports cars have engines that are about square or oversquare, meaning stroke is equal to or less than the bore. Economy and mass market cars almost always are undersquare, so stroke is greater than bore.", "Lots of terrible and incorrect bullshit in here, but maybe if I don't get buried I can clear it up: First of all, you can't really explain it like you're five. Understanding an engine completely basically takes a mechanical engineering degree. Ironically, your actual mechanic doesn't even understand your engine as much as he would imply he does. He might know fuel+spark=bang, but I assure that he doesn't even begin to understand the real thermodynamic realities of an engine. Assuming these engines are designed to be as identical as possible with no additional technology or special techniques between them, the biggest difference would likely be that the V8 would be smoother and possibly more powerful/higher revving due to better fuel/air mixing in the cylinder. Also, the V8 may have lower fuel economy at cruising engine loads due to frictional losses. Now, it's tricky to say for sure for this analogy because the change in cylinder size could be bore, stroke, or a combination, so let's assume proportionally scaled cylinders to not skew the analogy. Having smaller cylinders (but the same total volumetric displacement in total) means you can fill the cylinders with an air/fuel mixture faster, which allows for higher revving without losing the ability to successfully burn the fuel each combustion cycle. There's also other factors like the camshafts and valves being able to keep up (i.e. valve float), but we'll assume those are \"perfect\" in that regard. You may also have better low end power as well as even on the low end the ability to efficiently fill and combust in each cylinder will likely produce more power (again, super hard to generalize this much as a true 1:1 V6- > V8 comparison is almost impossible). Someone made an analogy to strong rowers vs fast rowers or something like that, but honestly that's more akin to comparing a high torque low revving motor vs a low torque high revving motor that output the same horsepower. So, why not make every engine a lower displacement V12 instead of of an inline 4 or V6? Biggest factor: cost. Second factor: reliability. Third factor: frictional drivetrain losses. The more cylinders you have, the more parts you have to make, inventory, and assemble. This naturally gets expensive and therefore the fewer cylinders you can use to get the power output you want, the better from a cost standpoint. Regarding reliability, this is a tricky topic as some will misinterpret it. In endurance racing, multi-cylinder engines are actually typically *more* reliable because using multiple smaller cylinders means each cylinder is producing less heat and can be more effectively cooled by the cooling system. It also means that if one cylinder fails in a non-catastrophic way, the car may still be able to continue driving successfully with minimal power losses compared to a car with fewer cylinders. However, in day-to-day situations, high cylinder count engines mean many more moving parts which introduces more potential points of failure, and it can also be difficult to tune (or, at least used to be back in the carburetor days). Going back to cost, get ready to open your wallet if you need the spark plugs or other service done as you are multiplying it by many times for that V12. As for frictional losses, this goes back to complexity. You have many more valves, valve springs, cam lobes, connecting rod bearings, etc. all creating frictional losses. This is why high cylinder count engines tend to have shitty mileage as during low throttle situations there is so much detracting from the power output and therefore requiring more fuel for the same amount of power. This further encourages companies to try to get the power they want from a 4 or 6 cylinder engine as it means (usually) better fuel economy at cruising power situations, which is where most drivers spend the bulk of their time. Now, all of this goes out of the window when you bring turbos or superchargers into the equation. All of the sought after 6 cylinder engines you hear about are durable variants meant for turbocharging, which effectively acts as artificial displacement when the turbo spools and introduces more air into the cylinders each combustion cycle. A large turbo V6 might act like a V12 with double the displacement when it comes to peak power output, but without the extra engine weight and frictional losses. Still, all of this said, it's so hard to truly make an apples-to-apples comparison as there would be so many nitty gritty differences between a 4L V6 and a 4L V8 to ever truly compare the two.", "Ford had a 300 cubic inch inline 6 and a 302 cubic inch V-8 for many years. The 6 had a 4\" bore and 3.98\" stroke. The 8 had a 4\" bore and 3\" stroke. Same bore in both engines, but the 6 had a longer stroke to make up the same volume. One big difference between 6 and 8 cylinder engines of equal displacement is that the 8 has more valves. Since maximum valve size is restricted by bore size, and since the 2 engines have the same bore, the maximum valve size is the same in the 6 and 8 engines in this example. More valve area (because of more valves) = more airflow. More airflow = more power.", "The biggest difference is cylinder size. First off: Piston= the part of the engine that moves up and down Cylinder= the tube the piston moves in. Revs= revolutions per minute. Redline= the maximum revolutions per minute. Bore= the width measured across the piston. Stroke= how far the piston moves. Power= how fast the wheels turn. Torque=how hard the car pushes. A 4l engine has 6x667cm³ cylinders as a V6, or 8x500cm³ cylinders as a V8. For an engine of roughly the same physical size and design, the V8 engine will rev harder, and have more power due to a higher redline, but less torque. The reason behind this is the engines size is defined as bore x stroke x number of cylinders. A longer stroke generates more torque, at the cost of a lower redline. A shorter stroke allows a higher redline, and gets to redline faster as the piston does not have to go as far. A smaller bore piston is lighter, and can rev faster, but must have smaller valves, which means less air. A smaller cylinder size must have either a shorter stroke, a smaller bore or both. The design choice is usually a shorter stroke, which gives a sportier engine, that revs fast and hard."]}

{"prompt": "How are Cities created/made\nAn elaboration of the question: I was talking to a friend about building new houses in the UK, and we asked ourselves how are Cities made? Is it just a collection of buildings which become a city. Or are they planned and set out. And If so, how do they get there name and layout? For example, I think Milton Keynes is the newest city in the UK. But how was it made and how did it get where it is and layed out like it did?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Well, it's interesting that you ask that from the UK. Historically, most cities arose as a result of humans wanting to live in a location that provided some economic advantage. Examples include a crossroads on trading routes, port cities, and areas with some natural resource to be exploited. Many of these cities grew up organically based on function and common modes of travel at the time. With European colonialism, cities were 'founded' in the New World and elsewhere. These communities were often planned by a royal governor and laid out according to the best practice of the time. When the Spanish settled the Americas, for example, the [Law of the Indies]( URL_0 ) established rules for where cities should be built and how they should be laid out. In the same vein, various US cities were planned and built by a single visionary 'planner'. Examples include Philadelphia (William Penn), Savannah Georgia (James Oglethorpe), and Washington DC (Pierre L'Enfant). In all of these instances, the city streets were laid out, and spaces such as parks and squares where reserved for the public. The private sector, individual homeowners and commercial developers, built the buildings along the streets according to the established plan. In 1902, a man named Ebenezer Howard proposed a new concept for creating cities: the [Garden City]( URL_1 ). The basic idea was that a city should contain all the elements that you needed, housing, industry, commercial district, etc. in a compact area that was separated by a greenbelt from the next compact community. He actually built a few of these towns in the UK: Garden City of Letchworth and Welwyn Garden. After WWII, the British government adapted this idea to deal with the crowded conditions in cities and the need for more housing, and sets out to build a series of new communities based loosely on the Garden City model. [Milton Keynes]( URL_2 ) is one of those 'New Towns' built by the government. I hope that answers your question. Some cities grow up organically because there was an advantage to settling there and others are planned and executed from a single vision.", "Planned towns often don't turn out the way people expect. So Welwyn Garden City (for example) was a deliberately planned satellite town in the 1920s. Its beautiful. Its a bit frozen in time (as I remember it from the eighties) Milton Keynes. Wow, thats one wierd place. Very zonal, very definitely a product of designers let loose. People who live there (in both of these cases) love it. visitors often don't Motherwell, and a bunch of other towns outside Glasgow were planned to re-house the slum dwellers from the gorbals. They turned into pretty bad places in some cases. New Cumbernauld, and the like have never appealed to me, but if I'd had to live in what they left behind (I saw glasgow in the 70s) I might feel differently. Linlithgow grew up around a chemicals, plastics and oil industry and was half way between Edina and Glasgow. Its a former royal palace town in fact. Formally, legally, its a city when its given a city charter. Historically, its when a cathedral is built there. In Australia, the economics behind trying to construct new city-like places hasn't always worked well. Allbury-Wadonga was sited at a border where the railway changed guage. rural cities by and large don't thrive in Australia because migration swelled the classic state capital cities which sprang up naturally on the coast. The exception is of course Canberra which like Brazilia and New Delhi is an entirely planned development. Old Canberra was socialize-by-rank and the style of housing reflected a 10 and 20 year planning cycle. New Canberra is now people who live there, second or third generation and its much less of a planned city culture, not everyone in Canberra is there either because of the federal government, or to sell guns, fireworks and porn out at Fyshwick. The other big exception is Queensland, which has a string of regional cities up the coastline. Since Queensland is a long thin(ish) big state, over 2000km long, maybe this worked better than it did in NSW, where the regionals like Wollongong and Newcastle are steel and coal towns, which died when the industry did (ok: unfair on both. Hit me) More recently, to try and limit the Gold-Coast Brisbane sprawl, we've had a clutch of semi-private city-like developments spring up. Springwood, and development close to the sunshine coast, partyly a venture-capital investment breaking new land (well.. farming land) and partly state government funded. The killer questions are always the same: where is the School, where is the Railway, where is the Hospital. So you can plan it, but \"if you build it they will come\" doesn't always work. You can grow what you've got, but thats urban sprawl. Planning is a nightmare. Legally, it has to be nominated and created. its just an overgrown town otherwise.", "Most cities just grow naturally by themselves. If you dig down in many cities in Europe you will find remains of settlements dating back millennia. Even among younger settlements there usually isn't much design involved. Just a bunch of houses being built close to each other and slowly growing from tiny village to big city. Usually there is something there that makes the place a good place to settle, like a road leading to a ford in a river or a pass though mountains or in some case nearby natural resources. Towns would be recognized as such by rulers and given privileges based on their size which further helped them grow. Things like tax jurisdictions and free trade policies helped shape where and how cities grow. If the growth of the settlement is fast enough somebody might try to direct an order the whole thing, but a few centuries ago urban planning was not really too much of a thing. There are however planned cities where there were none before. Milton Keynes is one such city that was created by design and not accident. A number of countries have their Nations capital be a designed and planned city, like Brasilia and Canberra. In such cases committees of designers and architects and city planners designed the general layout of the city and what went where from the ground up. eventually natural growth may take over and to a degree."]}

If we can build ships, planes, or even buildings many times bigger than the original, why did we not do so with trains?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Bigger doesn't always mean better. For trains, specifically, the advancement in technology has been in making the train stronger, not physically larger. There are three major reasons why making trains bigger is a bad thing. 1) Trains run on tracks, so making a bigger train would require replacing tracks with ones of a different size. While tracks have to be replaced eventually, there is no incentive to force the change by making a larger train. 2) Taller trains, which would be required to increase the size without increasing the width, would be less stable during turns, leading to more derailment and crashes. 3) Trains are already modular, and can be expanded near limitlessly by adding cars onto the back of the train. The only limit is the strength of the locomotive, and even that can be augmented by having extra cars for driving force. These trains can be collosal in their own rite, with the largest container train in the world being the 4.2 km long double-stack container operated by Canadian National Railway.

For older than 5, It's a bit more complicated than that, there's a \"torque curve\" meaning how much torque you have at any given RPM. If you have torque at low RPM, you can feel the push coming off of a redlight. If you have good torque at high RPM, you can get a push once you're already moving, good for passing on a highway. If you have a \"fat torque curve\" you have good torque at both low and high RPM, a good car for driving on curvy roads.", "The acceleration you feel is down to the torque at the wheels which is a product of the engine torque and the total gearing (gear and diff ratios, wheel size etc.). This means talking about engine torque isn't very useful in isolation as you need to know what gearing you can use which is dictated by what rev range the engine can produce torque over. In other words you could have a very low torque engine but if it revs twice as high as an engine with twice the torque, you could get the same wheel torque as you could gear it twice as low. Power is just the product of torque*revs/5252 so basically it takes the revs into account which makes it a useful figure for directly comparing vehicles as you don't need to know what the gearing is or anything else to get a feel for if it's a fast car (assuming it has \"appropriate\" gearing). Basically torque is transformed by gearing but power is an absolute figure that tells you how much work the engine can actually do. Perfect example being F1 vs Nascar, low torque/high revs/low gearing vs high torque/low revs/high gearing but both make similar power and perform similarly. You would predict that if you looked at their power:weight ratios but you wouldn't predict it from their engine torque:weight ratios.

When people say that an engine with high torque is better what the are generally actually talking about is an engine where the power is available across a wide band usually lower down the rpm range this is useful for towing for example as it saves the need for a large number of gear ratios to keep the engine at the required power. If you wanted to you could use a small high reving motorbike engine with all it's power concentrated in a narrow band at a high rpm.

A vector quantity has a direction and a magnitude, so imagine an arrow of a given direction and of a given length. Velocity is a rate of change in position, a vector quantity, and we call the magnitude \"speed\". For example, 30 mph going west. Force is a vector quantity, and we call it's magnitude \"acceleration\". Force applied to a mass over time will change it's velocity. So 30 mph going west and increasing west at 5 mph per second. Torque is force applied to an axis, so you can see how torque is important to acceleration. Work, force applied over a distance, will become important in a moment. The base unit is the joule. So applying 20 Newtons of force over 2 meters = 20 joules of energy. You can double the work by either doubling the weight and keeping the distance, or keeping the weight and doubling the distance. Power is work over time. The base unit is the Watt, and horsepower is a derived unit, so the two are convertible. In order to cross a room in half the time, you have to perform twice the work. So in order to go 200 mph, you need to apply torque (force) more frequently in the given period of time. So torque will increase your *speed*, but if you want to increase your *acceleration*, you need horsepower. You can have lots of torque, there are 14 cylinder cargo ship engines with pistons over 3' wide that produce ~8m ft/lbs of torque, and if that thing were fit to a car, it would absolutely get you to whatever speed you want to go, provided you had the appropriate gearing, but that doesn't mean it will accelerate you *quickly*.

Surely there's a good reason for this?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Depends on the design, but I think it's at least partly because of how older bathrooms did their bathroom sinks. Basically the sink was a bowl, and you filled it up with water from the faucet, hot water would be a separate faucet, and you would add that in to get the right temperature. Then you wash your hands in the sink, and pull the drain to empty it. The faucets were thus small so they don't get in the way of your hands. I know in the UK, many people still have this style of sink in the bathroom, [they look like this]( URL_0 ). In the US at least, we have gone away from that style of sink, and just wash our hands under the tap. But we still use faucets that look similar, probably for aesthetics reasons (putting a large kitchen sink style faucet would look odd), and partly because we still do wash things in the sink other than our hands, it may be useful to have a small faucet. And finally, if you're hitting your hands on the sink, it's probably because they installed the wrong faucet. On many sinks, the holes for the faucet are pre-drilled, their location is meant for a faucet of a specific size (one that stretches some distance from the edge), sometimes people buy sinks with the holes set back and couple it with a faucet that is short meant for holes set forward resulting in a faucet that's too close to the edge. Sometimes the holes are not pre-drilled and the installer drills them too far back. Spout reach is a spec listed for the faucet on home depot, people forget to check it when picking parts sometimes.", "The reason is probably cost reduction. The faucet is most likely a casting. Castings of consumer products are made in such a high volume that costs associated with design (such as fancy curves, etc.) don't impact the cost of an individual unit much. The primary cost is the material. A shorter faucet means less metal and a lower cost."]}
{"prompt": "Why does a hard, sudden rainfall cause basement flooding more so than sustained ordinary rain?\nAn elaboration of the question: Just had a very unusually hard rain fall in Brooklyn, maybe 10 minutes or less but rivaling intensity I've seen in Houston. Basement is flooded the worst it's ever been, but this doesn't happen (to this extent) even when it rains gently for days. So what's happening from a fluid dynamics/engineering/physics perspective here?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Roofs and gutters are designed to channel water away from the building at a certain rate. The same is true for the drainage on the ground level So long as the rainfall does not exceed that rate, it can go on indefinitely. When the rain comes down faster than that, the rate it arrives exceeds the rate at which it flows away, and it winds up going somewhere you rather it didn't."]}
{"prompt": "Where does human waste go on cruise ships?\nAn elaboration of the question: Hey so I was wondering, what happens to the inevitable waste in a cruise ship? Do they save it all up to be disposed of onshore or do they dump it periodically into the sea? Does it depend on the liner? What is the standing capacity for waste before a removal has to be made? - I appreciate that the last one is going to be ship dependant but I am so confused an estimate would be great!\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["There are two ways to deal with sewage: treatment and storage. Most modern ships are equipped with a sewage treatment plant. This plant can use either bacteria, chemicals, or other methods to break down the sewage and turn it into cleaner water. Depending on which regulation the ship follows, the treated black water is pumped over the side. If there is solid waste that still remains, or pumping over the side is not an option, the sewage can be kept in sewage holding tanks. These tanks are then emptied to sewage trucks/facilities when the ship is in port. In some cases, solid sewage is also allowed to be pumped over the side if certain requirements are met. On my ship, which has a max capacity of 26 people but regularly holds 16, our sewage tanks hold about 30 tonnes of sewage. We usually pump it ashore when it gets in the 20 tonne range, and we do so once every couple months or so. So, if 16 people produce about 10 tonnes of sewage a month, I imagine that a cruise ship of 1600 people would produce close to 1000 tonnes of sewage a month. That being said, Cruise ships also have top of the line sewage treatment plants that probably clean most of it up.", "On submarines (cruise boat not ship) we blew it out into the ocean using high pressure air Woe to the sailor who \"flushed\" a toilet when the tank was pressurized.

{"prompt": "Did mechanical and analog computers use Logic Gates before transistors? If so, how were they implemented?\nAn elaboration of the question: Also, if they didn't use Logic Gates, what did they use instead for arithmetic and such; and how was whatever they used instead implemented? Thanks\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["You can totally build mechanical logic gates and build basic computing elements like half-adders and more complex stuff from this. There are videos out there of people having build stuff like this from Lego and similar. [(Example)]( URL_0 ) The problem here is that these tend to be big and clunky and if you add up enough of them to be useful you will get into real mechanical troubles very fast. Electrically you can use devices such a vacuum tubes to have the same function as transistors made from semiconductors and build logic gates out of them. Early digital computers were build out of large numbers of vacuum tubes which had the unfortunate side-effects of burning out all the time, limiting the working time of computers and were also quiet big making miniaturization hard. Analogue computers (both electrical and others) were never that popular and didn't really use logic gates as they were never really based on the on/off dichotomy but instead worked by using what may thought of a sliding scale of values for inputs and outputs. Before electronic computer became common mechanical computers exited that may be said to be digital after a fashion, but they generally did not use the modern logic gate based design. There were calculators based on cog and wheel designs that you could use to automate basic arithmetic operations. Leibniz (who simultaneously with Newton invented calculus) created a working model of a mechanical calculator which function by means of cleverly arranged gears, cogs and cranks to allow someone to do basic calculations. This design with refinements lived on up until the point where electronics became good enough to build handheld calculators. The famous [Curta]( URL_1 ) calculator is an example of this type of mechanical computers that were used up until the 1970s.", "Analog computers don't really operate that way. Digital computers are based on logical operations, and they're good at what they do. Analog computing lends itself more toward straight mathematical operations on continuous numbers that would be difficult to do by hand, and they're (in many ways) better/faster than digital computers for that task If you're asking what they used instead of logic, the essential components of analog computers were called \"op amps\" or operational amplifiers. They don't do the same thing as transistor-based logic gates, but they're the basic building blocks of analog computers in the same way that logic gates and flip flops are they building blocks of digital.", "This highly depends on your definition of computer.

A very simple example of an analog computer is actually a [slide rule] ( URL_1 ). The first thing most would say is a \"real computer\" was the Z3, which used relays and switches to act as transistors. But you can build the whole functionality of a computer mechanically, too. The best explanation I found actually comes from an [advertisment]( URL_0 ) - sorry. What you do is basically the following: You place whips on a board and the drop marbles on it. Some whips have weights, meaning they always return to their previous position. Some whips do not, meaning each time a marble drops on them, they reverse direction, essentially storing information. The input to such a computer would be the order in which you drop marbles. The output would be defined, by which marbles land in the left or the right at the bottom of the board."]}
{"prompt": "Why do some structures (Radio towers specifically) have Red lights but, others use White Strobes? What is the difference between the two\nAn elaboration of the question: Had to repost because the Bot Mods removed it because it did not have a flair.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Tower climber here. I don't know the regulation by heart, but I'll say typically, a white strobe marks the top of the tower, while red (solid or strobe) act as side markers to show the tower's footprint. Not all towers are lit, it depends on the tower's height and it's proximity to an airport or flight path. So, a 199' tower that is not close to an airport may not be required to be lit, while a 150' tower, close to an airport will. You'll also find a lot of towers with heights such as 199 feet because they are built one foot shorter than the regulation requirement to be lit. You can voluntarily light a tower that is below the required height, but once a tower is lit, it must always remain lit and be registered on a FAA map. This is because, while the primary purpose is to be visible by aircraft so that they can avoid it, they also use the lights as landmarks for navigation. Lighting a tower these days can be very expensive because it requires a lot of maintenance, and also now requires a monitoring system to send a message when a light is out.", "I'm guessing you know already the purpose of these lights is to make structures visible for aircraft? As long as the lights meet the FAA requirements (or the rules wherever you are) colour doesn't really matter. White strobe (usually a xenon globe) is better during the day, red (used to be incandescents, but now mainly leds) are better at night. A lot of places use both (especially towers in high traffic areas) but some settle on one or the other or various reasons. (e.g. cost, maintenance, not pissing off neighbours with a strobe light, etc) As long as they meet the visibility requirement, it doesn't matter."]}
{"prompt": "Why are Fighter Jets so Loud compared to other Jet aircraft? and why does it make the specific sound of the sky being torn apart?\nAn elaboration of the question: I was at an Airshow yesterday, and I noticed that out of all the Aircraft there, the Fighter Jets were by far the loudest, and you could always tell whether a jet in the air was a fighter or not based on the Roaring/Ripping noise they make. what causes this? what is happening to the Soundwaves to make them sound that way?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The noise is mainly caused by the huge difference in velocity between the exhaust of the jet engine and the surrounding air. Modern day passenger aircraft use turbofans with a high bypass ratio, which means that most of the air coming out of the back didn't go through the combustion chamber, but just through the large inlet fan. This is much more energy efficient, since you can get a lot more thrust if you move a large amount of air at low speed rather than a small amount of air at high speed. It also has the beneficial side effect of reducing the noise quite significantly. The loudest types of engines around are turbojet engines, which generate all their thrust with the exhaust of the engine. This is not particularly energy efficient, but those engines are a lot smaller than turbofans of equal thrust, and therefore more aerodynamic. There's also a middle ground, a low bypass turbofan. Those are not as bulky as the models used in passenger aircraft, but also not as efficient and quiet. Modern jet fighters usually use low bypass turbofans with the addition of an afterburner, which increases the noise even further if activated.", "Were you in Yeovilton? Sad the Vulcan doesn’t fly any more. That’s an impressive sounding aircraft.", "In addition to the technical reasons already given, there's also the factor of the effect noise has on passengers and people on the ground. For passengers, noise decreases comfort. For people on the ground, there would be a *lot* more opposition to airports or increases in flights if civil aeroplanes were as loud as military jets. Both of these would have a negative effect on airlines' profits."]}
{"prompt": "Can you use the handbreak to stop a moving vehicle?\nAn elaboration of the question: So i have my driving license for a while now , but only recently I started driving daily have less than 7k km drove in my life.

Can you actually use handbrake to stop a moving vehicle? Or will not help if the normal breaks cannot stop ? (Edit : both at the same time just in case you belive you cannot stop with normal breaks) Does it come with a risk of losing control (on sunny weather). Do you actually have time to use it to avoid a crash with a stationary object or unless for some reason you have it as a reflex it will be too late? Driving an automatic transmission if it matters.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The short answer is yes. The handbrake is a brake, it will stop your car. The longer answer is: it may not be a good idea, depending on how the brake works. Your normal brakes are almost certainly *antilock brakes* (ABS) which automatically control the rate of braking and pulses the braking so that your wheels don't skid on the road. If you use your hand brake, it will most likely result in you losing control of the car and skidding across the road. That's pretty dangerous, as you can avoid a crash not only by braking but by turning away from the potential crash. Losing control is rarely a good thing, especially since you may not stop any quicker since your wheels are losing traction. Hand brakes work in a couple different ways, depending on the vehicle. Some of them are separate systems that bypass your normal brakes. Some of them, though, just lock the normal brakes down. In that case, using the hand brake won't stop you any faster, it will just avoid the ABS and make the whole thing more dangerous. Either way, you *can* use your hand brake to stop in an emergency, but you probably shouldn't if at all possible.", "The hand, parking, or emergency brake is usually, but not always, just your rear brakes actuated by a cable system instead of hydraulic fluid. This way it still works even if you lose all of your hydraulic fluid or if the master cylinder completely fails. But the brake pad or shoe the e-brake uses is usually the same one the normal system uses, so it won't add any stopping power if your normal brakes are working, and when used by itself it is much less effective because the front brakes do most of the stopping normally. You won't damage the emergency brake by using it occasionally, in fact it's recommended so the cables don't corrode in place, but there is another danger; The e-brake is designed to lock in place, possibly causing you to lose control of your car. To safely stop your vehicle with the emergency brake you have to remember to hold the button or other brake release so you can control how much braking force is applied and let up before the wheels lock up. This is also a good technique to use when starting from a stop on a steep hill with a manual transmission. Just keep the car from rolling back with the e-brake and release it as the clutch grabs. TL;DR - You *can* stop you car with it, but it won't be as good as the normal brakes and won't add anything if used at the same time. It should be used when parking on a steep hill or if your normal system fails, but you probably won't have fast enough reflexes to use it in a sudden emergency stop situation.", "The handbrake is just a metal cable connected to the brakes, it is not nearly as strong or efficient as the regular hydraulic brake system. It usually is only connect to the two rear wheels, unlike your normal brake pedal which is connected to all four. It may not apply braking force evenly to both rear wheels, which could cause your car to lock up the wheels and skid. Even under the best of conditions it will take a long time to slow the car to a stop. Take your car out to a parking lot that is empty and try it out. So yes, it technically will stop your car, but it takes a long time to do so and should only be used if your normal system has a complete failure."]}

{"prompt": "Why didn't old massive sailboats flip over, and why didn't their masts break being so far from CoM?\nAn elaboration of the question: I'm guessing they had massive heavy fins at their bottoms for the first question, but idk for the second one.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["not fins...ballast. The hull of a ship is typically loaded down with sand, stone, lead, etc to lower the waterline and stabilize the vessel.

Lots of experimentation and calculation went into knowing/predicting the strength of a mast. As it progressed over the course of centuries, the art of mastmaking actually laid the foundation for modern [beam theory]( URL_1 ). If you want to get a bit technical, it all depends on the [stress]( URL_0 ) in the wood. If the stress gets too high, the wood snaps. \"Too high\" depends on the type of wood, so shipbuilders would try to find the strongest species of tree to make their masts out of. The stress in the wood then depends on three things: it depends linearly on the applied force (double force = double stress), linearly on the distance from the deck (twice as tall = double stress), and inversely with the *cube* of the diameter (twice as thick = 1/8th the stress). So you take all these factors and try to set them in balance: wood type, mast thickness, mast height, and expected wind force. If you can only find weak woods to build your ship out of, then you can only use the thickest ones as masts, or you can only have a short mast. And even if you have a sturdy mast of good wood, you have to avoid wind speeds you didn't design for - you can't sail into a hurricane, for example, because the mast wasn't designed to survive that!", "They did not have massive fins but they had lots of weights at the bottom of the hull to counteract the leaning caused by the wind pushing into the sails above. As for the mast breaking, wood is pretty strong and bends before it breaks, the sails further up on the mast were smaller to reduce the load and in strong wind some might need to be taken down to prevent the mast from snapping.", "There was more of a concern of uprooting the mast than breaking it. The mast was basically a whole tree that was very straight and strong and cured over several years. It was then built into the ship. The large concern in really bad weather was the mast breaking loose and tearing out of the hull. That was the weak point."]}

It has this strange \"sport\" button, and when i press it, everything that involves the motor seems to work a lot better, but nobody could really explain that to me.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["It's highly dependent on the car, but what can happen may include: * If your car has a dynamic suspension, the shock absorbers may become more ridged, or the car may be lowered * Your power steering may be adjusted to be more responsive, or shut off (it typically shuts off at higher speeds anyway) * The engine mapping might change to produce more power * Traction control may adjust the threshold and parameters it engages to allow for more aggressive power transfer at the risk of some slip * Automatic or semi-automatic transmissions may adjust their shift points to act at much higher RPM * Certain features may be enabled, like launch control, if you have it EDIT: Your engine may \"work better\", but fuel economy goes right out the window. Your engine undergoes a shit ton of design and instrumented testing during it's development. They use these special test \"cells\" that control every possible operating parameter, and they run these engines through the gambit, essentially every possible speed, load, and environmental and atmospheric condition, at $10k/hr, to develop the \"map\", if you can imagine - essentially a gigantic table of all the operating parameters for the engine. Based on what the car's sensors are telling it, the computer will select the ideal operating parameters in the map. These maps are conservative, for fuel economy, emissions, and engine reliability. Normally, when driving, you're doing so under \"closed-loop\", where sensors provide feedback and the map selection is adjusted, as I had suggested above. Under the right conditions, such as under load or demand (such as going full throttle), the map switches to \"open-loop\", where the computer basically disregards the sensors and selects a mapping that produces power at the expense of all else. There's also a shorter term \"learning\" (used, very, very loosely) system that will make adjustments beyond the map. So if your engine develops a misfire, or a hot spot, or you used some shitty fuel, or you bolted on a turbocharger without tuning the engine for it, this system can mitigate all these things. So this is the system that changes when you go into sport mode. You're using a different part of the map and the operating parameters are adjusted differently for performance, sacrificing all else, which is why you turn it on when you're going to use it, and turn it off when you're not. Never just run in sport mode just because, as it puts unnecessary wear on the engine, running at higher RPM for no reason, and wastes fuel. As I said, this map from the factory is conservative, and meant to work under all conditions, appropriate for mass production and a world wide market. A tuner can adjust this map to gain performance, fuel economy, and emissions, by making it specific to your region. They can, it doesn't mean they will - because the manufacturer spent $10k/hr to develop their map, and any Joe in their garage and with a hand unit from Autozone can call themselves a tuner. If you were ever to do this, do your research and find a reputable tuner that actually knows what the fuck they're doing."]}
{"prompt": "Why is it that airplane flight sticks are configured to roll left/right when you move the stick left/right instead of yaw left/right?\nAn elaboration of the question: I'm not a pilot, but I've played flight sims (both \"real\" and arcade-like) since the 90's, and Kerbal Space Program for 4 years. This just occurred to me: Why is it that airplane flight sticks are configured to roll left/right when you move the stick left/right instead of yaw left/right? KSP uses the old gamer keyboard layout (WASD), and W/S are pitch up/down just like an airplane, but A/D are yaw left/right. Roll is set as Q/W. I've heard the flight stick described as \"moving the nose\" of the airplane. So it seems to me if you want to move the nose of the aircraft to the right, shouldn't you move the stick to the right? Instead, in a real airplane, you have to use the foot pedals which control the rudder, which is what actually makes the airplane yaw. Is it just some odd historical quirk that arose during the early days of airplanes and just kind of stuck? I know in those early days, all the controls were mechanical, with cables and pulleys and such connecting the controls to the rudder and ailerons. But these days, it's all fly-by-wire, so it shouldn't matter how the controls are set up, right?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The rudder isn't there for mainly steering the plane, but more stabilizing it, which is part of the reason it is controlled by foot pedals, as opposed to the stick. The rudder helps prevent slips and skids in flight. The plane performs best when the airflow comes in directly in front of the wings, going straight back, maximizing lift. If the airflow starts coming in at an angle, performance drops so we utilize the rudder to correct that. It is useful in manuevers however, such as crosswind take-off and landing, where you want to straighten out the plane to the runway, as opposed to letting it go with the wind that it wants to do. Some single-engine propeller planes, it is necessary for climbing due to [P-factor]( URL_0 ), where then the plane is moving against the relative wind in a climb, one side of the propeller blades will get a higher angle of attack as opposed to the opposite blade, resulting in uneven thrust, unintentional yawing and decreased performance (RIGHT RUDDER!) Now for why the stick controls the ailerons on the wings (which causes the plane to roll) for turning is because the wing itself is there for generating lift. In straight and level flight, the lift force is always vertical, away from the ground and opposing the weight of the aircraft. When the plane rolls, the direction of lift changes to an angle, away from straight up and not in line with the weight. The plane's lift now at an angle, with a horizontal and vertical aspect, giving the power needed to start a turn. The traditional plane shape, along with the vertical stabilizer (where the rudder is), will cause the plane to adjust to the new direction, but won't be perfect, which is where the rudder comes back into play! When you adjust the ailerons by holding that turn with the stick, you control the rate of roll, not the angle of roll. Once you get to the angle you want, you can straighten out the stick (mostly) to hold that angle, but still have that turn, but no longer needing to apply force. If you turned with rudder only, which you can do, but highly impractical, you would have to hold that the whole time, which would be a pain. To sum up, rudder stabilizes the plane, ailerons and wing makes it roll and turn, which is why the stick controls the ailerons and foot pedals control the rudder."]}

We've already built [a gun that can launch things into space]( URL_0 ), but they fall right back down. Staying in space means reaching a tangential (sideways) orbital velocity of 8000 m/s. By comparison, the muzzle velocity of that gun is only 2100 m/s, almost all of which is used to go up rather than sideways. Even railguns only reach up to about 3500 m/s. If you were to actually build a gun that could fire a projectile at 8000 m/s, it would immediately be destroyed by heat generated by friction with the atmosphere. We take advantage of this to slow spacecraft down from orbital velocity (reentry), but it doesn't destroy them because they have a heat shield and start out in the higher, thinner parts of the atmosphere and then descend into the thicker parts as they slow down. Therefore they're never subjected to enough heat to burn through the shield. But an object suddenly being accelerated to full orbital velocity in the thick lower atmosphere? Nothing can save it. Even if you assumed it to be indestructible, by the time it got to space it would have lost most of its velocity and wouldn't have achieved orbit. Of course, this is completely feasible on the moon.

{"prompt": "Why do most cars need a transmission\nAn elaboration of the question: I know that most cars need a transmission in them, manual or automatic, to make sure that enough torque is applied to the wheels from the engine, but I don't really understand why some cars can start in higher gears or or cars can be direct drive (electric/steam), what are gear ratios and how do they affect the \"gear\" of the car?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Power, in engine terms, has two factors Torque - how hard you're pushing RPM - how fast you're spinning Gears in transmissions like you take a high speed low torque input and make a high torque low speed output, perfect for getting a car moving. You can also take a medium torque, medium speed input and make a high speed low torque output, perfect for cruising at highway speeds If you don't have a transmission then the speed of the engine is always the same proportion of the speed of the wheels. This will result in you either having great acceleration but minimal top speed or terrible acceleration and good top speed. If you put in a fixed gear ratio and choose that your idle RPM (~1000 RPM) should result in ~5MPH so you can travel slowly, then your red line RPM(~6500 RPM) will only get you 32.5 MPH. If you decide you want to be able to hit 80 MPH without quite redlining(~5000 RPM) then your idle RPM will push you at 16 MPH, if you try to go any slower than that you'll stall the engine. An engine generates more power as the RPMs go up so in our example above the first car will have slow acceleration up to about 15 MPH and then it'll really pick up until it tops out around 33 MPH. The second car will struggle to get off the line and likely require a push to get going, then give you very poor acceleration up to about 50 MPH Electric motors don't need multigear transmissions because they have full torque at 0 RPM and a much flatter power curve than a combustion engine, and no minimum RPM like your car."]}
{"prompt": "How do home coffee makers move water from tank to pot without a pump?\nAn elaboration of the question: My first thought was it was some sort of gravity fed system, or a siphon but the pot is higher than the lowest point of the tank on my maker, now I think it uses the heat somehow but I don't know how that would work.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["There is a one-way valve at the bottom that only allows water to travel out towards the top. The water moves through the valve and is heated. As it heats up, it expands, and some of it turns to steam, creating pressure. Because of the one-way valve, the pressure pushes the water up the tube where it will eventually spill over the coffee grounds. Between the slight cooling and rising out of the way, the pressure is equalized on both sides of the valve, allowing more water to pass through from the reservoir to the heating element. Again, the water is heated, expanding, and pushing against the one-way valve, closing it and expanding upwards. [Here is a wonderful video explaining it]( URL_0 ).", "The power of boiling! (and little valves!) The flat plate that the carafe sits on is a heating element with two jobs. One is to keep the coffee that's been made hot. The more important is to heat the water from the tank so it can actually make the coffee. Water flows through a little tube to the heating elements. The heating elements are very hot (source: ouch!) and cause the water to boil. When that happens, the water turns to steam and expands. There's a little valve to keep the water from pushing back on the water in the tank. Instead, the only way for it to go is up to the basket of coffee grounds, where it turns ground-up toasted plant matter into liquid awesome. So, no, there's no pump, just physics."]}
{"prompt": "why aren't all yellow lights the same duration?\nAn elaboration of the question: Would it not prevent a lot of trouble to have all yellows be either three or six seconds?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["There are a few things that affect yellow light timing: 1. Travel speed. The yellow light has to be long enough for someone seeing it to come to a complete stop at the line, or someone driving through to clear the intersection on the yellow. 2. Intersection width. The yellow light has to be the correct length for the distance being covered for those clearing the intersection -- related to point 1. 3. Red Light Cameras. Some jurisdictions install red light cameras, and they have been accused of tuning the amber lights such that they get enough profit off the cameras to be profitable, but not enough to spur public outcry. A man in Oregon recently has undergone a bit of legal trouble because he did a study of optimal amber light timings and found that Oregon lights were not at optimal timings. He was fined for not being an engineer and speaking publicly about engineering topics. URL_1 URL_0", "A general rule of thumb is that the yellow light lasts one second for every 10mph the speed limit is set at. A road with a 30mph speed limit would have a three second yellow light, while a road with a 55mph speed limit would have around a six second yellow light. The yellow light is warning drivers to slow down because the light is about to turn red. An intersection with fast moving traffic needs more time to slow down, so it makes sense that a yellow light on this intersection would last longer, whereas a traffic light in a residential area doesn't need a six second yellow light."]}

{"prompt": "How does a small amount of Spandex woven into a non-stretchable fabric like cotton give the entire garment stretch ability?\nAn elaboration of the question: Wouldn't the cotton restrict any stretch from occurring?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["It's not really that the spandex is allowing the cotton to become more stretchy, it's that the spandex (until it is stretched) is retaining the tight/original shape of the garment. Instead of thinking of a garment-with-spandex vs an equally tight garment-without spandex, think instead of a garment-with-spanex against a looser garment-without-spandex. The looser garment is roughly as loose as the maximum stretch of the 'garment-with-spandex.' The addition of the spandex keeps the garment/weave tight.", "You can easily stretch most knit cotton clothing. The problem is that it has limited elasticity, so it will mostly stay stretched. The elastic spandex mixed in causes the fabric to return to its original shape. Woven cotton fabrics, for example denim, have much more limited capacity to stretch."]}

Is there anything else cool going on with them that wouldnt be apparent to someone like me who doesn't know much about them?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Just the top part. One cool thing is that there are several antenna elements stacked vertically inside each panel. That gives extra gain in the vertical plane. The generic term is sector antenna because each covers a 120 degree sector horizontally. That's why they are almost always mounted in a triangle. Newer ones contain the power amplifier as well.", "For AM radio, the structure IS the antenna. An antenna works by applying an alternating current to some sort of conductor. In an alternating current, the electrons are not all traveling one direction like water in a pipe, rather they move back and forth like waves on a beach. The number of times per second that the electrons move back and forth is called the frequency, and is often measured in Megahertz (MHz). When electrons move through a conductor, they create a magnetic field. If you have ever hooked up a battery to a coil of wire and created an electromagnet, you have seen this phenomenon. When an alternating current is applied to a conductor, the magnetic field is alternating in strength and polarity (north or south magnet) with the motion of the electrons. There is also a related electric field due to the distribution of electrons along the conductor. The changing electric and magnetic fields make electromagnetic waves, more commonly known as radio waves. Radio waves travel at the speed of light, which is about 300,000,000 meters per second. This speed is not dependant on the frequency. If you imagine an electron starting at the bottom of the antenna, which then travels up along the antenna until it is pulled back down to is starting position by the alternating current. This cycle repeats (like a child in a swing) and causes a radio wave to be radiated by the antenna. The radio wave travels a certain distance in the amount of time it takes for the electron to return to its starting point. This distance is called the wavelength, and is usually measured in meters. The length of an antenna element is typically either 1/4 or 1/2 of the wavelength depending on the type of antenna (although there are other designs that use of lengths such as 5/8). Most vertical antennas (like those for broadcast radio) are 1/4 wavelength tall. To determine the approximate size of an antenna, divide 300 by the frequency in MHz to get the wavelength in meters. Divide the wavelength by 4 to get the length of the antenna. For cell phone (around 900 MHz) the wavelength is about 33cm and the length of an antenna would be about 83mm (3.25\"). For FM broadcast radio (around 100MHz) the wavelength is about 3m and the length of an antenna would be about 750mm (29.5\"). For AM broadcast radio (around 1.7 MHz) the wavelength is about 176 meters and the length of an antenna would be about 44 meters (145 feet). Smaller antennas can be put on top of tall towers, but for larger antennas, they just use the tower as the antenna."]}

{"prompt": "Why do modern airplanes not use reverse thrust on all engines?\nAn elaboration of the question: I remember vividly when I was flying at a young age (think 727, A300 etc.) that after touchdown all engines went to reverse thrust. It was awesome for me as a child to see the jet engine \"morph\" like that. I have learned that most of the \"braking\" comes from the wheels. So my questions ist, why did they use it more in the 80s/90s. Why less nowadays? If it is inefficient, why do modern planes use it at all?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The only modern aircraft I can think of that doesn't have reverse thrust on all engines visible from the cabin is the A380. From what I understand the decision to expel reverse thrust from engine number 1 and 4 (the two outboard engines) was due to their position. The A380s wings are so large that the points at which the outboard engines are mounted can actually end up extending past the runways width. Usually this area is filled with grass. Now for this to make sense you need to understand what reverse thrust actually does. The thrust coming out of the engine when reverse thrust is engaged is not entirely redirected forwards it is also directed up and down and basically all directions but backwards. Its job is to destroyed the airflow over the leading edge of the wing (to diminish the wings ability to create lift) the redirected thrust will also cause the aircraft to decelerate, obviously... though its not that effective in actually stopping the aircraft. The effectiveness decreases with the speed of the aircraft. You can see what the thrust coming from the engines are doing when reverse thrust is engaged in [this]( URL_1 ) video. There is a lot of thrust being directed down towards the runway. On an A380 seen [here]( URL_0 ) the outboard engines will be most likely running over the grass or very close. If they had reverse thrust capabilities it would cause a lot of debris to be sent flying possibly hitting the aircraft or being blown onto the runway which would then cause problems for other aircraft. Also keep in mind that reverse thrust is only engaged at the pilots discretion. If the aircraft needs to take the last exit at the end of the runway the pilot may decide to use a lighter auto brake setting for the main gear and not engage reverse thrust so the aircraft can just use its inertia to get to the end of the runway faster. Its also common for 0 reverse thrust to be used. The engine still creates a small amount of thrust when it is running at idle. To maximise breaking efficiency on landing when reverse thrust isn't needed it is engaged but power kept at idle. The small amount of thrust created at idle power will still be redirected. Kind of off topic but good to know anyway. Hope that answers your question."]}

{"prompt": "Brian May famously uses his own, handbuilt \"Red Special\" Guitar, in a video, i saw him describe it having 3 Pickups and each pickup being in and out of phase, what effect does this have (other than sounding like Brian May!)\nAn elaboration of the question: For example, why would he need 3 pickups? what does being \"in phase\" mean? etc.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["A pickup is a coil of wire wrapped around a magnet. The coil has two ends, let's call them + and - for ease. When a string vibrates in the magnetic field produced by the magnet it slightly alters the magnetic field and this alteration is sensed by the coil. The output from the coil is alternating current/voltage. If two pickups are \"in phase\" they are wired with their like ends attached to one leg of the circuit and the other ends attached to another leg of the circuit. This results in the signal two pickups adding on top of each other because they are both picking up the same vibration. If it is wired out of phase (+ end of one with - end of the other) the result is that some of the negative output from one pickup negates some of the positive output from the other. The end result is a slightly quieter overall signal with some frequencies dropped out altogether. It's not perfect destructive resonance because pickups are positioned at different points along the string and, therefore, are not producing equal and opposite signals. In terms of number of pickups, you only need two to produce an out of phase tone, but having three to play with gives you multiple sets of two that you can select to suit your taste."]}
{"prompt": "What are the benefits of salt grinders?\nAn elaboration of the question: I totally get the benefit of pepper grinder.

So what is the different between \"freshly ground\" and not freshly ground? I crushed some salt and left it aside for 2 weeks, couldn’t find any difference between it and \"freshly crushed\" salt.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Aesthetics. It allows the salt and pepper grinder to match more closely since they now have similar mechanisms in them. Also, to some extent, you can choose grind size as others have mentioned, but that relies on the grinder actually having a grind selector. But it's more reliable to simply buy salt with the desired flake size and crystal structure, IMO. Size of crystals isn't really important, though; it's shape that is important. table salt has a dense cube shaped crystal, and kosher salt has a light flake like structure- kosher salt is more preferable to use in cooking because the flakey structure is better able to stick to moist surfaces when sprinkled, such as when seasoning meat) It's also important to know which a recipe is calling for- a teaspoon of table salt will contain more grams of salt than a teaspoon of kosher salt (which, incidentally, is one reason why you really should measure everything by weight, not volume, when baking)", "The main thing that separates different salts is the size of the salt grain. Some salts might taste different or have different colors because of trace minerals, but that's a different topic. Typical table salt is pretty small and cubic. That's fine for when you want to dissolve salt into something, but it's not good for making something taste uniformly salty with a small amount of salt. Sea salt and kosher salt tend to be larger flakes with a larger surface area. When you put those salts on top of something they tend to taste saltier with less salt. Ground salt isn't as large as most kosher or sea salt, but it is irregularly shaped and as a result tends to make things taste saltier with less salt when the salt is sprinkled on top of something. So when suing on top of food, table salt requires more salt to taste equally salty and is a little harder to spread uniformly. There's not really any difference if you're dissolving it into the food, though."]}

If you want to run a 2 mile long train full of coal or iron ore you're gonna need some seriously big locomotives. In Europe on the other hand huge trains simply weren't economical because of the shorter distances involved, and there were many old bridges and tunnels that couldn't support larger and heavier locomotives.", "Germany is only 399 miles wide.

Railroads tended to go for longer distances in the US which means they needed to be able to carry more coal. After a point this requires building a bigger Engine in order to not volume of goods that they can carry. These bigger sizes then allowed you to carry more goods on shorter runs, which in turn put pressure on the long haul trains to up their size again to meet that higher goods volume. By the time Diesel and Electric Engines were being made these larger trains and the trend to make the bigger and longer was well established.

{"prompt": "How is helium used by an MRI Machine?\nAn elaboration of the question: Based on a post below saying that MRIs use helium, I’m now wondering how. Can anyone explain?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["It is a coolant. The magnets in and MRI are incredibly powerful, they use superconductors to make such a powerful magnetic field. With regular copper wire, if you coil the wore and run electricity through it, it forms a magnetic field, and around 1% of the energy is lost to heat. MRIs are so powerful that the small loss to heat would melt the wires. So, they cool the wires with liquid helium, the coils become superconductors, which lose no energy to resistance at all. Liquid helium is very cold, it is -269C or -452F. It takes a lot of helium, compared to a balloon, because a liquid is much more condensed than a gas. Liquid helium is strange stuff. If you pack a hose with sand, a regular fluid like water will flow very slowly through it. Liquid helium has no friction, the sand won't slow it down a bit. If you started it flowing through a tube full of sand, bent the tube into a ring shape, and left it alone, it would keep spinning forever.", "Fun fact, once the magnets are powered up they stay powered up nearly indefinitely until things leach them down by converting their magnetic field into electricity or heat. IF you can keep them cool.", "Further to the above, not all MRI scanners use liquid helium. Superconducting systems using liquid helium as a coolant are the most common, as they have the best combination of performance at reasonable cost. There will need to be some sort of cooler used to condense any helium which boils off, but even without the cooler, the magnets are well insulated (they use a vacuum insulation), so it would take weeks for the magnets to warm up and lose superconductivity. Early MRI used permanent magnets - huge C shaped blocks of steel which were then magnetised - just like the horseshoe magnets you might have used at school, but 10 feet tall and weighing 40 tons. These are still used in niche applications - such as \"upright\" scanners. In an \"upright\" scanner, the magnet is on its side, and surrounds a reclining chair. You sit in the chair or stand up, allowing a scan of your back to show what happens when there is weight on your back. Permanent magnets are much cheaper than superconduncting magnets - but much, much weaker, so the picture quality isn't as good. The massive weight of permanent magnet systems also makes installation difficult, as they require super strong floors, massive cranes, etc. The latest technology is zero-helium superconducting magnets. Instead of putting the superconducting magnet inside a bath containing 1500 litres of liquid helium, the magnet is fused to a block of copper or aluminium, and that is then soldered to a cryo-chiller, which reduces the temperature to liquid helium temperatures without the need for liquid helium. In comparison, these are very expensive compared to liquid helium systems. They also run into big trouble if there is a power outage, because without the chiller running, the magnet will warm up and the magnet wires will stop super conducting, and discharge. It may take many days and cost many $k to recool the magnet and recharge it if that happens."]}

{"prompt": "How does resistive charging work?\nAn elaboration of the question: My friend has an electric longboard that says that braking helps to charge the battery. How does that work?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["This would be an example of regenerative braking. An electric motor works by running electricity through coils that produce magnetic fields. These magnetic fields in turn force a rotor to rotate, providing mechanical power. However, this process also works in reverse. If you manually spin the rotor, those magnetic fields oppose the motion and you induce a current in the coils (producing electricity). An electric generator and an electric motor are the same device (at least as the level we're talking about) - it's just one is performing the mechanical/electrical conversion one way while the other is performing it the other way. As a result, you can set up your motor to draw energy from a battery to create motion or you can switch a bit of wiring and use the mechanical motion to charge the battery. When you're charging the battery, the power you're putting into the battery makes the rotor harder to turn (causing a braking effect)."]}

{"prompt": "Why do so many passenger planes use the Deakin method (dragging the nose and then lifting off suddenly) instead of allowing the plane to naturally lift off and having a slower initial climb?\nAn elaboration of the question: Airport runways are more than long enough to account for the latter and it should be a lot less strain on the planes and is arguably a lot smoother. I understand that this allows the passenger plane to get to *Vy* faster, but is that the only reason? It seems more risky to passengers and if getting to *Vy* faster is the only reason, it seems like a dumb business decision that puts more stress on the plane and quite frankly, the passengers than what is needed.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Noise abatement, mostly. Long, slow climbs over populated areas tend to piss off the whiny bitches who moved in next to the airport and then complain about the jet noise. Just look at what the planes do at John Wayne (SNA). Line up and wait, lock the brakes, stomp on the gas and wait for clearance, then release the brakes and go hurling down the runway. At speed, yank back on the yoke and climb at 20-25 degrees nose up.

Might this be a revolutionary idea???\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["To avoid the loss of water into the surrounding soil every surface in contact with a body of water needs to be completely waterproof (impermeable). For in the ground pools all the cost effective ways of doing this use hard materials that are too solid for water to seep through. While softer materials for pools do exist (see: those above ground pools made of rubber) it would generally be impractical for an in the ground pool to use a flexible material as the motion would make it much more prone to cracking over time. Also if an edge was too soft it could risk people slipping into the pool. If this happened and someone drowned as a result it could easily be argued that it was the pool maker's fault.

{"prompt": "How does the choke work on a small engine?\nAn elaboration of the question: What purpose does the choke serve on a small engine like a power washer or a snow thrower? Why can't that be built into the engine?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["By restricting the amount of air mixing with the fuel in the carb being it reaches the cylinder. It's literally choking the engine.", "Under normal operating conditions, an engine will target an air:fuel ratio known as the stoiciometric ratio. If there's too much air relative to fuel, the engine is running \"lean\"; if there's too much fuel relative to air, the engine is running \"rich\". Large modern engines use a large number of sensors to electronically control fuel injectors. Compact engines such as those found in pressure washers and lawn mowers lack any sort of electronic control and rely entirely on a mechanical throttle and carburetor to control engine power. When an engine is first started, it is cold. The oil is viscous, there's no fuel in the intake, and there's no momentum in the flywheel. Thus, it's necessary to run the engine a bit rich in order to ensure that enough fuel gets where it needs to go. Once the engine warms up and gets moving, it will operate under its own power. What the choke does is constrict the flow of air entering the carburetor, creating a rich fuel mixture. This ensures a reliable start.", "A chokes job is not to limit the amount of air coming into an engine. It is to increase the amount of manifold vacuum seen on the main venturi to draw in additional fuel. The additional fuel is required because the fuel vapor condenses on a cold manifold and doesn't reach your cylinder in sufficient quantity needed for an easy start. A carburetor has 3 paths for fuel to enter the manifold. An idle circuit, a transfer circuit and a main circuit. The idle circuit is just a tiny hole below the butterfly plates you see when you look down into a carburetor, and sees full vacuum with the plates closed. The transfer circuit is basically a tiny slot that is uncovered when the plates start to move off their seated position. At this point there isn't sufficient fuel coming from the idle circuit and not enough air flow to start the main jets flowing. This supplies the additional fuel required to allow a smooth transfer from idle to main circuits. A choke circumvents the throttle plates some what by closing off some of the air flow before the main venturi. This is how the main circuit can see vacuum to supply the additional fuel. Is not readily there to limit air, but rather increase fuel entering the manifold. Clear as mud?", "So, you will notice that on engines with a choke, there is no primer ball. The choke is there to create a stronger vacuum to kick start the suction of gas from the gas tank/fuel bell."]}

What is limiting our ability to make something as efficient?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["A power source with a great enough power-to-weight ratio is one thing. The best we got is gasoline, but gas and combustion engines are heavy unless you're on the scale of a weed-wacker. Next after that is power transmission: taking energy from the motor and putting it in your arms and hands. Either this is done with relatively slow electric actuators, or very heavy but highly efficient and fast hydraulics. You could do it with electric motors and transmissions, but that would require far more electricity than what's portable for even an exoskeleton. Iron Man's suit appears to function with the power and accuracy of encoded induction motors comparable to CNC machine tools, but small enough that they have a form factor like a wrist watch or kneepad. This is far out of the reach of modern technology and may be that way for some time. Problems like these aren't matters of making things smaller like in computers.

Mechanical issues like these are matters of increasing pure material properties like energy density in batteries, conductance in wires, and compressive strength in structures.", "Power Iron man's suit only works because he has the arc reactor. We don't have one of those yet so modern exoskeletons that are doing heavy long duration work need a generator. They can either be tethered or carry a little Honda generator on their back, but batteries just aren't good enough for completely remote long duration operation", "Another issue I don't see mentioned here that applies to the Iron Man suit in particular is the concept of impulse, which in physics is the change of momentum in a period of time. Tony may have an iron casing, but he's still flesh and bone underneath. If he flies into a brick wall, his suit hits the wall, and then his body hits the inside of his suit. Now, with a suit he'd have the forces of impact more evenly distributed across his entire body, but that's not going to be enough to keep him from being crushed to bits when a tank's cannon knocks him to the ground at several hundred mph. Cars have airbags, crumple zones, and all sorts of technology designed to help reduce the impulse experienced by the human body in a car accident, but none of those things are mentioned (or even practical) in a suit like Stark's. Furthermore, the relatively low mass of the Suit compared to an aircraft or other heavy object mean his momentum will change much more than a car hitting another car, more like a motorcycle getting hit with a tractor trailer.

I would expect this to be true if the car is cold to start with, because it's pumping out hot air at first. As the car warms up, the air it pumps out is no longer hotter than the air already in the car, so there's no need to pump it all out near your feet any more.

{"prompt": "Riding a bike with 20+ gears\nAn elaboration of the question: I feel like I'm 5 asking advice on how to ride a bike but seriously. I haven't been on a bike since I was a kid and roads a bike I bought from Walmart that didn't require changing gears. Now that I'm 22 I inherited a really nice bike and I have no idea when to change gears.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["You change gears when you need more rotation from less distance of foot travel. Basically, like gears in a car. For instance, at first gear you can pedal up anything because there's almost no resistance from the gears. You will move slowly, but the bike will feel almost weightless to your muscles. As you need more speed you up the gears and each turn of the pedals will let you put more energy into the back wheels. This let's you move faster, but requires more work from your muscles. The easiest way to describe when to shift is when you no longer feel resistance from the bike. When the wheels \"catch up\" to your feet, you can easily up the gears and get more speed. Another way to tell when to shift is when you're pumping too fast. A good rider uses long, slower than expected strokes to keep speed. If you're pumping like you're trying to get the bike to climax, you're doing it wrong. One last thing, have your seat up high enough that your knees are nearly straight at the bottom of your downstream. And so your knees never go past 90 degrees at the peak. Your muscles will appreciate the lesser strain, and you'll have a better ride in general.", "if I can echo the OP here, I have a bike with 27 gears. That's 9 on the right hand and 3 on the left hand. I generally can get by just shifting on the 9 on my right while keeping the left gear in 2. If I were to go through all 27 in theory, how would I do it? Do I keep the left on 1 and go to 9 on my right switch and then switch my left gear to 2 and then try to get my right to 1 again???", "One thing to watch put for is don't use extremes in the gear ratios. For example do not use out most gear on the front and the inner most on the rear. Doing so puts a lot of stress on the chain and prematurely wears it out. It might have 20 plus ratios but you should probably only use a put 16 of them or so for maximum life and use. Optimal cadence for pedaling distance is about 90 to 100 rpm. It's hard to get used to at first. Slower cadence feel more natural but they actually fatigue you faster. It's more cardio that way hut it gives you much smoother power. Also, don't think of the downstroke as the only power stroke. Especially if you have clips instead of standard petals. If you don't have clips, get them, it opens up a whole new world of distance biking. With clips you have the down stroke, then at the bottom you pull your foot backwards like you're scraping dog shit off the bottom. Then as the foot comes up you can pull up using the clip for a more consistent power around the entire stroke of the pedal. If you do have clips and have never used them. You will fall over. It happens. It happens to everyone that gets them almost. Anticipate gear changes before you go up hills. Trying to change in the middle of a high power stroke makes it more likely to jump the sprocket or break the chain. Neither are fun. You might have to increase to a faster cadence at the bottom of the hill to downshift, but you'll be less likely to need to shift mid way up. Edit. The real advantage of years is you can switch to a gear that allows you to maintain cadence independent of terrain."]}

This would let them poke yoke the assembly process and makes you less likely to put the wrong screw in the wrong hole", "I am actually very passionate on the subject of screw/bolt heads. Phillips heads only advantages are it's ubiquity and ease of manufacturing (which go hand in hand) , all Phillips can be made security screws, they suck as transferring torque (stripped heads) and the sizes are easily misinterpreted causing you to strip them more easily, best application is putting them on threads that self tap (wood screws, plastic, sheet metal, drywall...because you are already pushing pretty hard). Torx are the best because the driver either fits or it doesn't, there is no in between(it's almost impossible to strip the head), can transmit the most torque by a long shot (used to hold engine blocks together or very small parts), but they are expensive to make and no one has torx drivers at home (by far my favorite head, mostly due to application ). Allen is in the middle of these two being somewhat resistant to stripping, kinda easy to make,most people have a driver set at home, these are probably the overall best head type. Flat heads are basic af but the lack of self centering prevents power tools form being used. Hex heads are like Allen but only require one driver for all sizes (medium hard to strip, easy to make, ubiquity), they also do not require as much clearance to turn them. JIS (Japanese Philip) improved version of Philip, can transmit more load, can be distinguished by hash marks between each groove, still not suitable to hold any kind of load, their greatest weakness is being stripped by Phillips drivers because who the fuck has Japanese screw drivers (other than me).

What accounts for this? Why could DJI not make a smaller battery with double the mAh? What physical constraints are happening here?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The phone's battery, I'm pretty sure, is 5 volts; what's the voltage of the drone's battery? The energy stored by a battery is the product of amp-hours and voltage, not just the amp-hours by itself.", "The issue is two fold, but first two basics: Current, measured in \"Ampere\" basically means \"How many charge-particles, electrons, flow per second?\" while Voltage, measured in \"Volt\" means \"How much energy carries each of those charge-particles?\" Now for the two aspects: --- First, the possibly less important thing of the two but still valid: mAh, or \"ampere hours\" means that you can pull one ampere for the given time, so if it says 3.8 Ah (the same as 3800 mAh) you can pull 3.8 ampere for an hour, or 7.6 A (double 3.8) for half an hour, 1.9 A for two hours or 0.38 A for ten hours. The massive difference between a drone battery and a phone battery is that the drone battery needs the energy in a much shorter time, if you fly half an hour you need to pull the 7.6 ampere from it to fly your drone. Fully draining it in 20 minutes - the phone could burst into flames or at least get damaged. Therefore the drone battery needs to be heavier due to more powerful components and wireing. --- And second, the more important thing: Ah (or mAh) is telling you nothing about the transferred *energy*. For that, you need to take a look at the voltage at which the one (or 3.8 or whatever) is pulled. You calculate Wh, which is \"watthours\", which basically means of much Watt (= energy) a system gives or takes per hour. You calulate this by Ah * voltage. So if you have two batteries both with 3.5 Ah and your mobile phone works at some 5V you have 3.5 Ah * 5 V = 17.5 Wh. But the drone might require 12 V or even 18 V and as such you'd get some (let us just use the mean between 12 and 18 for this example) 3.5 Ah * 15 V = 52 Wh. This means both have the same Ah, but one can deliver that 3.5 Ampere-hour at 5 V and the other at 15 V, meaning the drone battery can store and deliver 3 times the energy of the phone battery.", "The drone battery is 3.8 Ah at *11.4 volts*, and the galaxy battery is 3.5 Ah at only 3.8 volts. The drone battery holds a lot more energy. Also, because size is not as much of a constraint, the drone battery is probably not packed in the same way. I'm guessing inside that battery are cylindrical cells rather than teeny little flat rectangular ones.", "I wish they wouldn't use mAh as a measure of battery capacity: it doesn't tell the whole story. It's OK as a *relative* measure for comparing batteries for the same voltage, but *only* at the same voltage. To get a measure of the energy capacity of a battery, which is what really matters, you need to multiply by the voltage to get a mWh figure. For example, if you have a battery marked 2,000mAh, its energy capacity at 5V will be 10,000 mWh (10 Wh), but at 12V it would be 24,000 mWh (24 Wh), and probably more than twice the size!", "On top of everything else mentioned, the safe discharge rate for a drone battery is gonna need to be a *lot* higher than the discharge rate for a phone battery. Your drone might draw as much as 10 amps constant current, whereas your phone might only draws 100 milliamps. Using those ballpark numbers, the drone battery needs to safely discharge 100x more current than the phone battery on average which means; - Cells that can tolerate said discharge rates need to be physically bigger, - The packing of the cells can't be as dense to allow heat dissipation, - The size of the wiring between cells and the circuitry will be bigger to accommodate the high amperage."]}
{"prompt": "How does a elevator algorithm work?\nAn elaboration of the question: Considering there are multiple elevators going to the same floors.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The elevator algorithm is simple: 1. If there is a called floor in the direction the elevator is going, go there 2. Otherwise, if there is a called floor in the opposite direction, change directions and go there 3. Otherwise, go nowhere (or sometimes go back to a specific floor) Generally with multiple elevators there is no coordination beyond not servicing a floor that another elevator is already headed to. There *are* more advanced algorithms. The Marriot Marquis in NYC was known for having wait times of up to 30 minutes, and about a decade ago installed a [destination dispatch]( URL_0 ) elevator system. Users punch in their desired floor in advance, and the system tells them which shaft to use. This allows a computer to optimize the elevator use more efficiently.", "The elevator algorithm is actually pretty important in computer science. It is pretty simple to understand though. When called, the elevator will prioritize the calls that are in his way, then it goes the other way. If the elevator is going up, it will continue to go up until there's no one left calling it in the up direction or until it reaches maximum floor. Then it goes down with the same logic.", "The real answer is: It is *very* complex. In the most simple approach you click a button and a software determines which elevator goes there and then blocks all others from answering that call. In reality... it is vastly, vastly complex and engineers and computer scientists work on it. For example, modern algorithms try to base where which elevator does what based on the time of the day, for example: * in the morning a lot of people want to go from the \"bottom\" to all kinds of floors further up with a massive peak demand * during the day most people want to drive around in the house but the demand is spread more evenly, the algorithm might attempt to reserve elevators for certain parts of the house, one might jump a request if it already has many buttons pressed from the inside, and another is scheduled for that outside-request * unless it is around noon, when all kinds of people want to go down for lunch * and in the evening a lot of people might want to go down to the bottom again. * many, many, many more cases depening on time, the type of house (only offices in there? A mix of office and businesses? Entertainment venues (a club on the roof? A gym in the middle? Shopping center? What if there is also residence in it?). All that said: There are probably entire careers in CS/engineering for \"elevator optimisation\" and every manufacturer has his own, probably very well guarded algorithms with custom ones for special houses (you can bet that the Burj Khalifa does not steer its elevators with Siemens-Standard-Algorithm#2 they might roll out for some 5-story residence). **tl;dr There is no general answer and the issue is vastly complex.**", "A little bit offtopic, but if you know a little bit of programming [this]( URL_0 ) game may be interesting.

Now I'm too excited to remember what I wanted to ask about!! I feel like a kid who meets their favorite celebrity and can't muster a word!! I have considered elevator algorithms for far more time than I want to admit. Now I can't even get it out. Ok so.. in a medium apartment complex, 10 floors, say.. and two elevators. Which one comes first? A or B? Probably A because of programming. If elevator A is on the 10th floor and opening while someone on the 8th floor calls I find that elevator B will come up. But wouldn't it make more sense for the algorithm to be 'pause', 8 is calling. I know that if I call the elevator *after* A on 10 is closed it will come to 8, but not if 10 is still open and it's next stop is undefined. I guess it's all about programming, but can a 50yr old system be reprogrammed that way? Also, what gets elevators stuck between floors? Like, why does that happen? If elevator A is on floor 5 and elevator B is on ground floor, who gets the call for floor 3? More complexly, if elevator A is on floor 10, and B is on 3 and both are programmed to return to 1, which goes to 5 going down if someone on 6 wants to go up at the exact same time?", "They aren't standardized. so... any algorithm you can come up with that makes sense is and is relatively simple is probably being used by an elevator somewhere."]}

Some at the tune of 5k or more for JUST the unit, no labor, expensive special fluid or taxes included. I have witnessed customers literally scrap their 4 year old car due to the cost of unit replacement. The repair often times costs more than the vehicle is worth. Until they start making serviceable units, I would keep with conventional automatic transmissions. With technology like dual clutch drums, and the usage of sprags and other types of one-way clutches, we are now able to make 7,8,9 and even 10+ speed automatic transmissions, allowing for more efficient gear changes and keeping the vehicle in it's optimal performance range.

Did the architect know his work would change color or what? Thanks! EDIT: Copper. Not Bronze.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["It is a choice made in the design of a building... Originally it had to do with longevity and reliability of the materials - if you look at steel, the rust that forms when it is left exposed is detrimental - as it rusts the material degrades and gets thinner and weaker until it fails. So steel needs maintenance and protection to last long term (such as bridges being painted, or having steel encased in something like concrete to protect it). The green of bronze however is actually helpful - initially it is nice and shiny, then degrades to the green colour we commonly see, at which point that green layer has created a barrier around the metal, so it doesn't degrade any further. So once it reaches that point it needs relatively little maintenance and upkeep - great for a feature dome at the top of a roof you don't really want to have to access regularly. It is also worth remembering that most of these structures are traditional ones, built when technology and materials were far more limited, so the green roof was a small price to pay to be able to actually build the structure that may not have been possible with other materials. Nowadays it mainly comes down to architectural reasons - it will be used to give a certain look and design to a structure that the architect desires.", "Yes, architects know their roofs are going to turn green.

Newly installed copper roofs, for example, are chemically treated to promote the brown oxidation, since it will protect the underlying copper from weathering.

There was a case many years ago when a group of \"good samaritans\" cleaned some oxidized bronze statues in their city to restore their luster.

{"prompt": "How does greater locking surface in a firearm increase its accuracy?\nAn elaboration of the question: Heard it multiple times in videos of Forgotten Weapons youtube channel. As I understand this is primarily about semiautomatic weapons and follow-up shots?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Say you have a hammer and nail. If the hammer head is bigger than the nail, then the force of the hammer is distributed evenly against the head of the nail. The nail will go straight into the wood. Now say you have a hammer and a nail, but the nail head is bigger than the hammer. When you hit the hammer against the nail head, it's likely to be slightly off center. This will cause more force on one side, and the nail will go into the wood at a slight angle. So the bigger the surface area of the hammer head in relation to the nail head, the more likely the nail is to go into the wood straight. This isn't as big a deal if you hit the nail dead center each time, but it's hard to do that. People tend to be slightly off with their aim when swinging a hammer, and even reliable machines have tolerances where they are slightly off. Now just substitute the hammer for the locking mechanism in a gun, and replace nail with bullet, and you'll get why increased surface area on the locking mechanism increases accuracy."]}

So, like, okay, clearly it's not very popular. And then we said, okay, let's expand that invitation to all customers, but I would expect that all customers behave roughly like that initial sample group.

{"prompt": "why do bombs and missiles explode in the air above their target? Instead of hitting the ground/target and exploding?\nAn elaboration of the question: Edit: thanks for all your informative responses! I have a lot to read through\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["In an impact detonation (bomb that explodes when it hits something), that \"something\" absorbs most of the force of the impact. If it is the ground, a majority of that force is transferred into the ground and some of it is reflected back up into the air (think of a ball bouncing off the ground, it bounces back in the air at a very similar angle that it impacted the ground). For harder targets where you want to concentrate the force in a smaller area, this is the technique you want to use. In an air burst bomb (using either a timed fuse or a radar proximity fuse) the shockwave travels toward the ground, is reflected by the ground, similarly to the ball theory and meets with more shockwave. The meeting of this ground reflected shockwave and the Air shockwave change the direction of travel of both and causes them to run parallel with the ground. This amplifies and shockwave and pushes it outward, away from the central point of detonation with more force. Fragmentation damage is an effect in both cases. In impact detonation the frag is reflected upward and out from the ground (since it impacted the ground first) and is slowed somewhat by the contact with the ground. This is the desired effect for harder targets. In an air burst the frag pattern is directed toward the ground with more force (initially) and then pushed outward by the outward directed shockwave. This is more desired for softer targets (vehicles, radars, personnel). Alternatively in a delay burst, the weapon impacts first and then a set time delay is executed prior to fuse actuation. This allows the velocity of the weapon to penetrate harder targets so that it may detonate inside the target. This is useful for concrete, buildings (sometimes depending on construction), armored targets (depending on the weapon), tunnels or bunkers. There are caveats to each of these situations.", "With a ground burst, a lot of the explosion energy is used up by the ground/material very close to the explosion center. An air burst can cause damage over a larger area, but causes less destruction at the explosion site than a ground burst. It becomes a question of strategy. Does the attacker desire to damage an entire city or level a single block?", "In WWI the combatants lobbed enormous volumes of artillery shells at each other, to not much effect (on a per-shell basis, at least): it's estimated that over a hundred shells were fired for each combat fatality during the war. The ineffectiveness was because the shells were mostly impact-fused, meaning there's a little gadget in the nose of the shell that is deformed on impact, setting off the explosive charge in the shell. This detonation, while quite fast, still took a little bit of time, during which the shell would usually bury itself into the earth. When it finally exploded, the surrounding dirt absorbed most of the force and shrapnel. Artillerists experimented during the war with timed fuses instead of impact fuses, set before the shell was fired. The idea was to calculate how long the shell would take in its path through the air, and set the fuse to burst the shell while it was still a few meters in the air. When it worked, this was extremely effective and greatly multiplied the destructive power of the shell. The problem was that it was very difficult to get right and rarely worked, resulting in the shells usually exploding high or in the ground anyway. In WWII, the British invented a device called the cavity magnetron, capable of generating high-energy radar waves. The secret of the technology was given to scientists in the United States, who embarked on a project of miniaturization and mass-production. The end result was a device that cost $18 and could be screwed into the nose of an artillery shell and used to trigger the detonation. This device (called the \"VT fuse\" misleadingly) could be set for a variety of ranges. The original purpose of the VT fuse was for anti-aircraft work; hitting a moving target directly with a shell was essentially impossible, while detonating nearby required precise estimation of altitude and proper setting of a timed fuse. With a VT fuse, it was only necessary for the shell to come with 60 feet or so of the plane and it would detonate. But it also occurred to the developers that it could be used to air-burst shells, with the radar reflection from the ground detonating the shells at extremely precise preset altitudes, causing massive destruction to whatever/whoever was underneath. While the VT-fused shells were used by naval vessels from 1943 onwards, they didn't appear on the battlefield until their first use in late 1944 during the Battle of the Bulge (and *very* handy they were then, an under-appreciated reason for eventual American success in the battle). The navy got them earlier because of security concerns - the US didn't want the Germans or Japanese to get their hands on a fuse that had failed to fire, but over water this would have been virtually impossible. By late 1944 it was clear that Germany was finished, so even if they had acquired one of these fuses it would have taken too long for them to reverse-engineer it and put it into production. Bonus factito: the cheap miniaturized cavity magnetrons eventually made an appearance in consumer goods - inside the microwave ovens we all have now.", "USAF Ammo Troop here (we build all of the ordinance that's dropped by aircraft) Depending on the fuze, guidance unit, mission requirements, payload, purpose of the munition, etc. , you're able to set the fuse to when it should detonate, HOB (height of burst) for how far above the target it should detonate, or even set the fuze to wait after impact to detonate, and build the bomb accordingly to allow penetration before detonation. (Big ammo troop pun) search BLU-109 on YouTube. Reason I mentioned guidance units, is depending on whether or not it can be controlled from the pilot or ALO on the ground, they're able to guide the munition and detonate it as they see fit. To fully answer your question as to \"Why\", it totally depends on your target. If it's a soft target, say personnel or just normal trucks, it's easier to use an air burst with small metal projectiles (brass normally I think) that will essentially shower the target with shrapnel. This can even be applicable with heavier targets, such as tanks, because there's certain types of shrapnel that can pierce straight through armor or even engine blocks. A good example would be to search a flechette. They're like small little steel darts that are used as airburst shrapnel for personnel targets. We used this early on in the war, and back then the size wasn't regulated by NATO. Meaning each size of the flechette differed, some much larger than others. There were reports of targets being literally crucified to trees - so NATO demanded the regulated size of them to now be a 1/4\" long. I may be off very slightly on some things, but that should answer your question.", "Before fancy fuses, everything hit the ground and exploded. The problem with this is that when something hits the ground it takes a little tiny bit of time before the fuse can tell the explosive to go bang. By that time, especially in soft ground, the explosive is now slightly in the dirt. When it goes bang, the energy wants to go where it is easiest to go. So a lot of it goes up and out of the dirt. This makes a cone shape extending upwards from the explosive. The problem is that people and thing at ground level aren't in that cone. So most of your explosive is wasted unless you got really close. Then people figured out how to make fuses explode pretty much whenever they wanted them to. So now we can use that explosive as well as all the sharp bits of metal along for the ride (shrapnel) to be more useful. Anti-aircraft and missile defence applications explode in a cloud of shrapnel when their guidance tells them they are close enough to the target. This increases likelihood of hits to control surfaces, fuel, engines and electronics. A lot of anti-personel applications also allow for airburst usually on a timer or range. This allows the warhead to send shrapnel downwards and means people hiding behind walls or in trenches aren't really safe. Most anti-tank missiles use a shape charge warhead which requires a precise distance from the armour in order to be most effective. Most will have a long pointy bit on the end to trigger the warhead at this distance. It may therefore appear like it explodes before hitting the target. However some specialized munitions have various range finders that cause detonation if they are close enough.", "Exploding in the air means that the shrapnel hits a larger area and goes into trenches that a ground detonation would miss. The devices used to achieve this are called proximity fuzes.", "if a bomb explodes on the ground, it does a lot of damage in a small area. That might not be the best solution. If it's detonated a little above the ground, the force is less, but the area is larger. If you want to destroy buildings, you can turn more of them into rubble, rather than just turning one corner of one into dust. It all depends on the objective you're trying to accomplish.", "It's called the \"mock stem effect\", first seen in the Halifax explosion in WWI. In an airburst, the downward-going shockwave will reflect off the ground and join up with the shockwave radiating out parallel to the ground, thus intensifying it. When Hiroshima and Nagasaki were smoked in 1945 those bombs were both airbursts, the lesson being learned in Halifax.", "If a bomb or missile explodes in the air, it's using a proximity fuse. This is usually a tiny radar in the fuse that detects when it approaches the ground (or an aircraft for anti-aircraft missiles), and triggers the warhead to go off. The fuse would be set to go off at the distance that the warhead will be most effective. You'd see proximity fuses on weapons designed to kill through the blast wave of the explosive going off or through shrapnel created by the metal casing around the warhead splitting up into pieces. The best targets for these types of weapons are troops in the open, or in uncovered trenches, unarmored vehicles, or aircraft. By exploding the weapon above the ground, all the blast and shrapnel spreads out as much as possible and isn't wasted moving dirt around. It's an old concept that dates back to even before the invention of radar, but back then they used a fuse that was timed to explode after so many seconds and then fire it at targets that were just slightly more than that many seconds away. It's where the \"bombs bursting in air\" from the US National Anthem comes from. Timed fuse bombs. And as a side note, when the radar fusing technology was invented, it was called \"variable timed\" fuses to hide the fact it was actually being triggered by radar fuse. There's also a proximity fused weapon used against tanks. This is a missile that is designed to fly over the top of the tank and explode when it gets directly above the tank. When it does, it creates a molten metal slug that is fired by the explosion directly down into the tank.", "The reason for an airburst is for troops in the open or light skin vehicles. When bombs go off at point detonating there for armored targets and generally the most available fuzes carried by assets. Then there's delay, which is for hard targets such as bunkers, bridges, airstrips, buildings, and punching through a thick canopy forest. Reason you would use delay on a building is because there is 2-3 feet of plywood roofing material rafters that would absorb most of the shrapnel if it was air burst or point detonating. This is for 250, 500, 1000, and 2000lb bombs as well as small rockets and missles as well as artillery.", "There are a lot of great comments in here. For some things - like surface to air and air to air missiles you have a much better chance of shooting down the aircraft if the missile explodes in the area of the aircraft rather than just hitting it. Because it's actually pretty hard to hit a plane in midflight as compared with getting near it and then blowing something up. Likewise other targets are more affectively damaged or destroyed by point or area detonation depending on what they are. Troops out in the open you probably want to use arborists – but those same soldiers in a bunker you want to hit directly."]}

This is actually a common misconception; the difference is almost *entirely* due to the higher compression ratio of diesel engines.

{"prompt": "Is braking with your front wheels as fast as braking with your back wheels?\nAn elaboration of the question: Condsidering you're using the same energy to brake. (car, motorcycle)\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Front wheel braking is more powerful. As you brake, more weight is thrown onto the front wheels, so they can actually brake harder and harder. The opposite is true for the rear wheels: as they become more lightly loaded, the less they can contribute to the overall braking force. Every car has bigger, more powerful brakes on the front because of this phenomenon, and it applies to bikes just the same.", "When a car brakes, the front noses down and the back lifts up. This puts pressure on the front wheels. So, if the front wheels are doing the braking, that added weight on them increases traction, hence better braking. Back wheels brake too, but as the vehicle weight shifts forward, they lose traction. They are much more likely to start skidding, which reduces traction even more and lessens braking power. However, if we talk about a bicycle/motorcycle, while the same principle applies, the front wheel can brake so hard the back of the bike can lift off the ground, and flip over.", "The braking force you can get from a wheel depends mostly on the amount of weight it carries. If the center of gravity is right in the center of the car, all wheels will more or less brake with the same force. However, once you start braking, the load of the vehicle shifts towards the front, and therefore your front wheels will have more traction than the rear wheels. That is very noticeable on a bicycle: If you engage the rear brake, the wheel will easily start skidding without slowing you down much. Meanwhile, pulling the front brake too tight will give you so much braking force that you might flip over. The same thing happens in a car (except the part where you flip over), which is why the front brakes need to be stronger than the rear brakes."]}

This means if you apply a force to an object that doesn't move, it will accelerate in the direction of the force (only if nothing prevents it, like a table, or air friction, etc.). If the object was moving and you apply force against its direction of movement, it will slow down,and eventually accelerate the other way if you continue to apply force. Momentum is the product of mass and speed. This quantity is the image behind the fact that a light object moving fast and a heavy object moving slow can have the same impact on a surface for exemple. (not exactly right, but gives the idea I think) Work is the energy you spend to move something. It is the product of the amount of force and the distance on wich you apply the force on the object. Let's say you are pulling an object lying on sand. The object will experience some friction (=force) from the sand. If the force applied by the sand is constant and, say, equals to 10 Newton, and you pull the object on a 10 m distance, then the work is 100 Joules, meaning you spent 100 Joules to move the object in those conditions. Power is the product of speed and force. In the same exemple as above (object pulled on the sand), the power (in Watt) is your capacity to pull the object with more friction from the sand. The more powerfull you are, the more fast you can pull the object, or at the same speed but on a more \"frictionnal\" sand. Hope this helps."]}

My AC was barely cooling but I will be more aware of what's going on the next maintenence.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Automotive air conditioning has much more difficult set of situations to work with. Many of the components are sharing the same space as the engine, exposed to the temperature and environmental extremes the engine is, which makes them degrade over time. The compressor is bolted to the engine and gets its power from it. This means the compressor much accept power from an external source, usually through a pulley attached to a shaft with a seal, which will wear and leak eventually. This also means the compressor moves with the engine, and the system accommodates this motion with rubber hoses which is also a major source of leaks. Parts are made to be replaceable, so some type of seal or gasket is necessary between them, which can, yes, leak or fail. Contrast this with a stationary application like a refrigerator. The entire system is usually plumbed with metal tubing with only small amounts of flexing, so no dynamic seals or rubber hoses, or gaskets. Even the compressor is encased in a metal shell, the only seals are for the electrical connections, but since there is no motion, these seals can be made to never wear out and almost never fail."]}

Environmental When rain is dropped it helps support wildlife in that area. Step 4. Politics After implemented, It would come to the point that local governments would fight over who has the \"most need\" of the water.", "The problem is the relatively short amount of time the water arrives in. When that much rain falls all at once, the established infrastructure is overwhelmed, which leads to flooding. You'd have to completely redo all the underground drainage.

You now have to buy the property from everyone who owns the land the pipeline sits on. That's another huge expense, even if everyone sells willingly. Those who resist and force/fight eminent domain, will drag the process out for years and the legal costs could easily double the construction costs. Then, there's the issue of operating costs. Electricity for the pumps, maintenance of the pipeline, worker's pay and benefits. That would likely make the water coming out of the pipeline ungodly expensive. I haven't even mentioned the environmental considerations. When a storm like Harvey destroys a town, most of that water would be contaminated. Fuel from damaged storage tanks, chemicals from the paint store that was blown away, the saltwater mixed with rainwater caused by storm surge, etc, etc, etc....

If you do it afterwards, you might need to decontaminate the entire pipeline if something really harmful were introduced to it.", "You're talking about moving millions of gallons water thousands of miles. It just isn't feasible. Moving the water takes energy. Conveniently, the Sun provides a huge amount of energy for moving water around the entire planet. That energy drives our weather, which moves [37.5 million *billion*]( URL_5 ) gallons of water all around the planet. It also conveniently moves the water thousands of feet into the air, where it can land thousands of feet above sea level, where the Earth conveniently uses gravitational potential energy to move the water around through streams and rivers. Also, conveniently, the Earth has been geologically active for a few billion years so there's water trapped underground in convenient locations. It's relatively simple for us to move water a short distance from where the Earth and Sun have maneuvered the water to where we need it - we've been doing it for [thousands of years]( URL_4 ). Still, historically humans have settled in areas that already have lots of fresh water that flows relatively slowly - ie. in big, wide rivers like the Nile. But water is [heavy]( URL_3 ), so getting it uphill is very difficult. So the first problem is moving the water *out* of flooded areas. That's already tricky, and the reason areas flood in the first place. Flood plains are wide, flat areas that collect water and down allow it to flow easily out. Places that experience chronic flooding, like coastal cities, often spend millions of dollars building drainage systems that provide an outlet for the floods. That often means constructing [levees]( URL_2 ) that channel water around flood plains so it collects where we want it instead of spreading out all over where we don't want it (like our streets and buildings). Those are powered by gravity, though. We don't pump it out, we just let gravity do the work. Some places *do* use pumps, but that's only moving water a few hundred feet at most to put it back inside the levees and rivers to let gravity do its thing again, not thousands of miles into another state. We do, of course, move water around that we use from natural sources of water to somewhere else. Controlling our water is often a [massive undertaking]( URL_0 ). Even locally, we [prefer to use gravity]( URL_6 ) to move our water around. We use *small* (relatively) pumps to move a little bit of water into the towers where gravity will deliver it to our homes. And that's not to say anything about the massive cost of laying the pipes and pumps. There's a lot of stuff in the way: rocks, rivers, mountains. Pipes are subject to damage, so you have to build them big and bury them and protect them. Just replacing the pipes in Flint could cost [billions]( URL_1 ). That's just replacing the water pipes in one city. Granted, that also means digging up old pipes and the pipe has to be safe to deliver clean, drinkable water. Nonetheless, you're talking about transporting millions of gallons of water thousands of miles away, through mountains, across different elevations. It's just absolutely not possible. It's also mostly unnecessary."]}

With the snorkel, the engine may still run. If the tires don't have traction, and the current is noticeable, does any of this matter?", "Mostly it's electromechanical & air related. If air can't get into or out of your car because the intake / exhaust is under water you will stop pretty quickly. Dirty water can cause a short so electrical systems are a problem also. Many cars don't have waterproof seals, so driving through water that goes above the bottom of the door / above chassis level is just a messy idea.

The wheel itself (metal part in the middle) is made to bulge out so you can take one and turn it around so it's touching the other one to make the double wheel that is in the back.

{"prompt": "Why do semi trucks in the United States have front wheels where the lug nuts protrude past the edge of the tire while each subsequent wheel has recessed lug nuts?\nAn elaboration of the question: Currently on a road trip from southern to Northern California and all the trucks we've passed so far have this pattern. Is this an industry standard? Or does it relate to safety in some manner?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["It's because the front wheels are single (like on your car), while all other wheels are dual. Because of this, the centers of the wheels extend past the edge of the rim. This means you can put two wheels face to face, and bolt them together to the hub. When you look at a set of dual wheels mounted, you see the concave side of the outer wheel, so you see the lugs as being recessed. Since the front wheels are single, they mount them the same way they do the inner wheels of each dual pair, meaning with the convex side facing out.", "Hey guys, first time commenting here on ELI5. Truck mechanic here and I wanted to take a chance to clear some misconceptions up that some people have as well as confirm others. The front (Steer) wheels are singular and are turned essentially the same way that any car or truck wheel faces with its concave facing outwards. The inner rear axle dual also faces this same direction if you look closely at a set. The second rear wheel on each hub is placed there because the axle is rated to hold a higher weight than that of single rear wheels. If a vehicle has what is called a \"super single\" (A single overly large rear axle tire) it has the same weight capabilities as a axle with duals. The benefit to this is fuel economy which tires play a factor in. While at one time they were very expensive in there early years they have drastically come down in price to actually be cheaper than replace 2 tires in some areas of Canada and the US. I was reading some of the comments about interchangeability of the Steer tires vs the rear drive tires. To say that people are wrong and you cannot interchange wheels and tires would be incorrect. But to be clear though, most Highway tractors have different steer tires vs drives. Again fuel economy is a factor. The steer tires are generally smooth grooved with more of a streamlined pattern. At the end of the day they are there for just that. Steering. there is no driving force being applied to them so they are designed to provide minimum rolling resistance with optimal steering capabilities. The drives usually have a more aggressive tread pattern for a balance of grip, wear control and you guessed it fuel economy. Also side note here, retreaded tires are illegal as steer tires here in the great white north. Not sure but it is likely the same in the US. Lastly as far as wheel torque goes this is something of a myths/legends vs science question. A lot of mechanics I knew of coming up in the trade believed that torquing a lug nut on a car was as easy as listening for a the right amount of bangs coming from their impact gun when tightening a set. Some believed in the \"hit em hard with you gun and then torque em after\" approach while others swore if they did not use a torque wrench on every lug nut a wheel was sure to come off. The correct answer is the last one but with a procedure of assuring each lug actually moves when torquing. If they do not and your torque still clicks you have torqued nothing. The lug nut is already over tight which can be as dangerous as under tightening. Over tightening stretches the wheel studs which the illustrious engineers worked so hard to design. This one of the big causes to wheel coming off on trucks and cars as the studs can shear or time allowing the wheel come loose. TL:DR Amounts of tires and sizes are all put into the design of the vehicle when ordering it for maximum efficiency. In some cases the customer can go against recommendations due to cost or applications. As far as maintenance goes. If your the one working on it. Torque it. The cost and damage of a 150+ pound tire and wheel into someones windshield costs far more than the time it takes to use your torque wrench. As far as everyone else goes. choose a reputable dealer/shop for your tire needs. p.s. Those shiny pointy things some drivers put on lugs are just for show.

That means, that the rear wheels on a truck (known as the drive wheels) are mounted face to face.

The same goes for 1 ton pickup trucks, cargo vans, anything with \"duallie\" applications.", "Why do some of them put spikes on those tires?", "The front has only one tire. The rear has two together. All the rims and tires are the same. In the back the way they have two is they have the outside rim flipped around. Doing this causes the two rims to touch. They have to have all of them the same because of flats or rotating tires. So in the front they stick out because the rim needs to be able to be put in the back so the plate of the rim sticks out past the lip. So if they have to put them together (make them kiss). The tires wont touch.", "I didn't see anyone else mention this, but maybe I just missed it. The centers stick out so much because the hubs behind the wheels are HUGE. They are massive because they are heavy duty and built to run hundreds of thousands of miles. Much like pickup trucks have different style hubs - a smaller truck, using Ford terminology - say an F-150, has smaller hubs and therefore can use car-like wheels. Go all the way up to a Heavy-Duty F-350 or more correctly a Super Duty F-450, like a Tow Truck or something - you are going to see a wheel that starts to look a little more like a full size Tractor wheel, and the hub behind it is similar. These are simply massive, with much larger, beefier bearings inside. The wheel is shaped like a \"cone\" to both provide clearance for the huge hubs, and to locate the actual tire in the right place so the steering works properly. If the wheel were flat instead of cone-shaped, the tire would be much too far outboard of the steering system, and instead of turning in place and pivoting in the center of the contact patch, it would turn in an arc sort of around the hub. Hard to explain, I guess.", "There's a lot of true info here in these comments but they are missing the salient point. That is, the centre of the tyre tread must be in the same vertical plane as the centre of the wheel bearings assembly. This is to ensure correct loading. Trucks must have enormous heavy-duty hubs, brakes, and bearings, so the wheel needs to provide room to accommodate these. It's the same reason your car wheels are offset with the majority of the rim being inboard from the plane of the wheel stud holes. The hub, brakes, and bearings have to sit inside the wheel and centred. That's why the studs and nuts are on the outside. The rear wheels on trucks are dual, so the outer wheel appears to the eye to be dished or concave because the hub sits inside the inner wheel.", "What if you turned the front wheels around and mounted them backwards. Would it affect performance?", "I have sort of a related question. Why do some Semi trucks have spikes on their lugnuts?", "In europe the semi's front wheel lug bolts are required to have a protective guard ring over them. In the US we add spikes to make them stick out more", "The rear wheels are mounted in pairs. Bolts that extend as far as both tires would be too weak (and get it the way when working on the wheels. The front wheels are mounted as singles and don't need a hub that looks different from those on your car.", "In a regular car, you have a spare. That spare can be used on any of your four tires. Semi's, and duelly pickup trucks have the front hub stick out farther, while keeping the tire under the vehicle for this same reason. To be able to use one spare, in any position. It is also so they only have to carry one type of spare, which could save on weight. Which on semis is a huge deal. That's 200lbs (est) less cargo they can carry What happens if you blow a front (steering axle) tire, but only have a rear axle/trailer axle wheel? You're hooped.", "the easiest explanation is that the tires that appear concave, are actually a dually axle, its 2 tires. The outer tire is concave for mounting purposes. The inner tire would look similar to the front tires. URL_0 The reason the inner tire, or the front tires stick out, is because they cover the braking system, similar to a passenger car", "Diesel mechanic here. The front and the back wheels are exactly the same. The front wheel has the concaved part of the wheel facing inside so it goes over the hub. The back has duel wheels, so the inside tire mounts just like the front and the outside tire is flipped around so the concaved part of the wheel is facing out. I hope this makes since. This is the first time I've tried to explain this.", "Am I the only one that drives by trucks and think one of those lugnuts are going to magically pop up and propel into my brain while I'm driving. It's a weird anxiety...", "Nothing here has been dumbed down enough so I'll give it a try. On an axle with two tires on each side there are two different rims that are bolted to the same hub so the rims have an offset. The rim that you can't see on the inside is protruding out. It touches the side of the outside rim that is protruding in.", "The correct term is offset. The fronts use negative offset (like fast and furious cars) which brings the rim further inside the fender and puts it directly atop the a-arm which affects how tightly it will steer. The rears use both positive and negative offsets. They position the inner tire closer to the axle (using negative offset) which puts the lugs further out alowing the outer rim to bolt on safely and more securely. Positive offsets are what give big 4x4 trucks a wide stance. They extend the rim out well beyond the lugs to widen it, giving a lifted truck better stability.", "TL/DR: Front axles have a single wheel and the wheel fits around the axle hub. On the rest of the axles, the first wheel looks just like the front with the single wheel, but an additional wheel is flipped 180 degrees and placed against the single wheel, giving it an opposite dished appearance.

{"prompt": "Why are trailer tractors so boxy and non-aerodynamic?\nAn elaboration of the question: So, first of all, there's a shape difference between tractors in Europe and the ones in the US. EU ones are pretty much a flat surface slamming against the wind at 100+km/h. US tractors have a front mounted engine, which gives them a seemingly more aerodynamic shape. However, when brought together together in the same plane, the engine and the windshield have roughly about the same surface area, with both surfaces being mostly flat. I don't know if the US trucks are more aerodynamic or not, so some input on this would be nice, as well. The overall question, however, remains: how come aerodynamics doesn't play a role in truck development? Considering the fuel costs, the large front surface area and the speed they cruise at, you'd think aerodynamics would be something truck manufacturers should be all over.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["EU tractors generally have their passenger cabins mounted on top of the engine instead of having the engine be in front of the cab. This makes the tractor look much boxier than American styles but it also makes them shorter. Being shorter is much more important in Europe because many cities have small roads with tight corners that aren't as common as in America.", "I'm an aerospace engineering grad so can provide some insight into this. The default, most aerodynamic shape is a tear drop (fat end into the air). A lot of people think a knife edge is more aerodynamic because that's what they see on fighter jets. But take a look at this fighter from 1945: URL_0 It has a rounded nose, just like a modern commercial airliner. Sharper noses only came in when people wanted to go super-sonic where aerodynamic rules get really different. Anyways. If a teardrop is the best shape, how far off that shape is the front end of a truck and how could we improve it? It turns out, when you start to consider the stuff you need in the front of the truck (and where it has to be places so that you are good with local highway axel loading rules), you just don't have much wiggle room. You could improve things a bit, but not that much. The interesting thing is that the BIG aerodynamic savings are to be had at the back of the truck. That flat surface deviates significantly from the tapered end of a teardrop and creates all sorts of excess drag. The problem is, that;s where stuff gets loaded in and out of the truck, and a giant spike sticking out the back of a truck isn't a safe idea.", "A reson for the difference in max length. In continental Europe the max length is 18.57 m, 40 ton and 24-25.25m, 60 ton in Scandinavia (the reason is that the extra length make it possible to have 3 instead of 2 cut to length stack of timber because the forest industry is important in Scandinavia). It is economical to have a cab over engine design to maximize the amount of cargo space I the US there are no federal max length but there are weight limitations of 36 ton so there is no incentive to make it compact the same way With those limitation is it not strange that the designs are different. I is liley the case that increasing aerodynamics would reduce capacity and be non economic. A flat front is not that bad for aerodynamics. A flat back is worse Look at how [aircraft wheel covers looks like]( URL_0 [5]-1784-p.jpg). They are quite bulky at the front and pointier at the back. That design are that way for a reason", "As much as it looks like things aren't aerodynamic these things tend to be heavily engineered towards being as fluid as possible while considering other handling characteristics. Many others have pointed out about the size restrictions so I'll leave that unsaid as other commnets seem to be more than enough for that. What I will say is take for example the Volvo FH16 truck. You look at it and you think it's very poor for aerodynamics but when you start looking into it you'll notice subtle things about it's design aimed at improving the CD (coefficient of drag) rating of the vehicle. Take a look at this image; URL_0 Looks like a massive flat wall with a slight curve at the very edge of the cab doesn't it. Now look at the plan overview of the truck and what do you notice. URL_1 I bet you should be able to see that there's a very slight curve to the entire front of the vehicle. The figures I've found is that most Cab over Engine trucks in Europe have C^D around 0.55-0.70, Most mainstream modern cars are around a value of 0.20-0.35. Now when you consider how much larger of a profile a truck has, then you soon can see that the figures are pretty impressive as an FH12 is from the figures I can find about 3 times the size of most cars in terms of cross sectional area (I've looked up a few common European models). It's also worth adding that a lot of the parts on a truck (or other vehicle) are designed to be for aerodynamics not just in terms of the coefficient of drag but also to aid grip for the tyres, improve road holding and other performance metrics beyond being a fluid shape. Making a vehicle perfectly aerodynamic is possibly a great idea if you plan to use it in a straight line on perfectly dry roads with no wind or weather influences. For real world use you have to deal with pushing them into the road surface to press through rain to combat aquaplaning, to work against strong winds to prevent roll overs and many other things."]}
{"prompt": "Why do street lamps' power cables run underground and not overhead like those between pylons?\nAn elaboration of the question: It would definitely be easier to hang the cable over than dig trenches in between poles, and also use something like a third less of that precious copper cable, because the wire doesn't have to go up and down each pole. There must be a reason for this, so what gives?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["I've been building and maintaining street lights for a decade or so. Unfortunately, the answer is that it kind of depends. Let's start with why cables are in the ground. There are several reasons. * a cable won't interfere with traffic. I.e, it will never hinder any kind of heavy machinery transports. You know the kind. They are typically too long, too wide, too heavy and in this case also too high. * A cable is, once it's dug down, very hard to steal. * As long as you don't interfere with the environment of the cable (i.e, as long as you don't go there with a digger or drill something) it will be well protected underground. Hanging cables are subject to weather-related issues such as sunshine, salty winds, stormfallen trees and something as simple as the wind making it grind back and forth multiple times a minute all day long, for more than a decade. * street light cabling is often a totally isolated grid. It's only powered on from dusk til dawn. So, the lamp post grid feeds along the roads, often branching off in a different direction. That means that you will pretty often have cables not only along the road but also CROSSING the road. It looks better, and it's safer to have a crossing that is dug down. Despite this, hanging the cable on a pole is sometimes the chosen method anyway. Mostly because it solves a few issues that makes it worth the drawback. * If you have to use dynamite to get the cable down, it's gonna up the cost of the project. Sometimes to somewhere in the vicinity of ten times as high a cost. All for virtually no gain. So, when you can't dig down the cable for practical reasons, it makes sense to consider hanging the cable on the poles instead. * When you have a faulty cable, you'll have to put in quite a lot of effort into finding not only which lamp posts the faulty cables goes between, but you also need to get a pretty exact location of the fault so that you start digging at sort of the right spot. The fault is typically located with a pretty heavy surge generator and a geo-microphone. By inducing a spark that ignites in the actual fault in the cable, you produce a sound in the ground that you can listen for with the microphone. It needs to be dead quiet when you locate the fault, so if your cable happens to be right next to the highway you need to close it down while you locate the fault. That is generally frown upon. A cable that hangs up in the air will instead shoot a visible spark, so the fault will be found in mere seconds. * Replacing a faulty cable between two poles that hangs up in the air is done in an hour, while digging down a new one takes at least a day. Sometimes it's simply not acceptable with the waiting time. And again, if this happens to be between the lanes on the highway it's gonna be a lot easier for everyone if the highway is closed for an hour than if it's closed for a whole day. * Sometimes you want lights in areas where you don't have access with skylifts. Yes. Those places actually exist. Think a narrow running-track in the woods, or an overpopulated island where you need a special permit to bring any kind of fuel-consuming vehicle, and when you get there you can't navigate around with a truck anyway because there is simply not enough space between the houses for one. If you got that kind of environment, your only option is to use wooden or composite poles so that you can climb them with tree pole shoes. And if you can't get a skylift in there for maintenance, you are gonna have a hard time when you want to dig up something too. And that leaves hanging the cable instead of digging. And, oh. If you look closer on a steel lamp post, you notice that there is a small hatch on it, about a metre up. The expensive cables end there, and a noticably thinner one runs up to the actual fixture. EDIT: I forgot to add that when you hang a cable, you also get all kinds of problems related to traffic accidents. They are really no fun then.", "So the cost really isn't the copper. It's the labor to install them. So when a parking lot or street is being paved it very easy to go ahead and install the wires underground. What isn't cheap is repairing the lines if they are damaged. Let alone the liability of having hundreds of feet of live power lines above poles that if are hit by cars will be near pedestrians. Do it once right and you never touch it again."]}

Gravity is a weak force and generating enough for it to be a structural concern (that acts in any direction other than towards the earth's core) is a materials science problem more than engineering.

They only support a few configurations, and they test them to make sure they work.", "True \"software\" inside of vehicles is a rather new concept. Vehicles have contained integrated electronics since the mid 1970s. The introduction of electronic fuel injection in the 1980s necessitated an engine control unit (ECU), and mandatory diagnostics in the 1990s made them a legal requirement. The ECU in most vehicles is a controller with a built-in ROM serving as a large lookup table. It takes a lot of sensory data such as engine temperature, intake manifold pressure, airflow mass, exhaust O2 mass, engine RPM, cranking status, fuel pressure, throttle position, etc... and controls things like the spark plug timings, AC compressor clutch, radiator fan relays, air-fuel ratio, fuel injector timings, throttle valve position, cabin blower power, etc... The ECU is also responsible for collecting diagnostic information and presenting it to an OBD/OBDII reader. Many enthusiasts modify the contents of the ECU's lookup tables in order to achieve better performance on fuel-injected engines. Early ECUs were very simple ASICs with no microcontroller component and thus no software to speak of, everything was pure hardware. Modern vehicles have numerous Electronic Control Units controlling virtually every aspect of the vehicle from the radiator fans to the trunk door. Note that I'm now using ECU to refer to Electronic Control Units rather than Engine Control Units, which are now one of many ECUs contained in modern vehicles. As you may imagine, this can and does add complexity to both the original design and subsequent maintenance. A modern vehicle may contain a dozen different ECUs with some ECUs having different microarchitectures than others and thus requiring very different control programs. As for how they're designed, it's no different than writing a control program for a CNC machine, an aircraft, or a power plant. It's done very, very carefully; it's validated by multiple engineers; then it's not changed unless it absolutely has to be changed. Each ECU runs its own program until the end of time. Programs written for personal computers do not undergo the same degree of validation as programs written for electronic controllers that are to be put in moving vehicles. Many design philosophies, such as agile programming, are absolutely verboten for good reason. Despite that, bugs and defects still make their way into vehicle software from time to time."]}

If we were to fire all the scientists, stop all research, change nothing about our society forever, then you're right, eventually, we'd run out of rare earth minerals, we'd be recycling old solar panels, and hit an energy peak we'd never overcome. But we only need about 500,000 square kilometers of solar panel to power our entire world on current technology, and each square meter of panel needs 20g of silver. That means that a square kilometer needs 20 million grams of silver, and that the planet would need 1 trillion grams, or 1 million metric tons. As a species, we have 1.4 million metric tons of silver in storage though, so while that natural barrier without technological growth would exist, it wouldn't be insurmountable. But, as we said, these technologies change every year. For now, the materials required are adequately abundant that we don't need to consider changing them. Coal, while abundant, has become more expensive than solar, and it's technology is fully saturated, with no new research on how to get more power out of coal than we do now. There's also the important consideration that there are no side effects of solar power, whereas coal generates more and worse side effects the longer it's used."]}
{"prompt": "Why aren't power lines in the US burried underground so that everyone doesn't lose power during hurricanes and other natural disasters?\nAn elaboration of the question: Seeing all of the convoys of power crews headed down to Florida made me wonder why we do this over and over and don't just bury the lines so trees and wind don't take them down repeatedly. I've seen power lines buried in neighborhoods. Is this not scalable to a whole city for some reason?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Hi! I'm actually an estimator for a large electrical contractor, so I think I can comment on this pretty accurately. In large cities you're correct, there's a reason you don't see power lines draped across buildings in Manhattan. And even more affluent neighborhoods will have the lines buried. But there's one enormous reason that ALL lines aren't buried: cost. Now this answer had been given, but there's some details you might find interesting. The first is initial installation. Most underground cable at distribution voltage (4kV to about 35kV but that definition fluctuates) is installed in buried conduit, and basically every construction company can tell you that digging sucks. Even with a geotechnical report, some areas of the country are a total crapshoot as to what you'll find 3' down. In parts of VA it might be the water table, in parts of ID it might be lava rock. Usually the ground is either too soft and the hole/ trench doesn't hold up, or too hard and it takes forever to dig. Either way that means money. Digging also isn't very pretty, and most places have lots of rules regarding how you dig, when you dig, what you do with the spoils (dirt you dig up) and what you have to do to clean up afterwards. If you dig in the middle of nowhere this isn't bad, but God forbid you're in the rich part of town. Then on top of all this money you spent following the rules you now have to spend another big pile fixing landscaping (ya know that bush you dug up? The fourth one from the end that was almost dead? Yea, that was my great great grandmother's golden bush of infinite happiness! You owe me $5000 for it! No an almost identical bush isn't good enough!). Not too mention underground conductor is more expensive. The conduit it goes into is an added cost, but it pales in comparison to the price difference between underground wire and what you'd spend on overhead wire for a similar amount of current. Additionally this wire has to hold voltage that is desperately trying to release itself into the surrounding earth, so if you nick it when pulling it in, or damage the insulating jacket in some other way, congratulations you get to pull that wire in again! Because that electricity will arc that gap and the line won't work. If that happens later on down the road, it's also much more difficult to diagnose and fix. With an overhead line, you can usually tell what's wrong (hint: what parts that should be in the air are now on the ground?) But with underground lines you have to drag out the thumper. The thumper is a piece of equipment that applies a voltage to a line. The voltage goes higher and higher until it arcs through damaged insulation and makes a thump sound underground. Then a worker has to locate the fault (damaged piece of line) by walking the route of the line and listening for the thump. Now newer equipment is fancy enough to help you get pretty close without much work, but there's still a lot of experience and good luck to finding the fault quickly. By the time you add in the cost of the thumper, the crew's time to actually dig up and fix the line, and the outage time for the customers being fed, you're taking a pretty penny. Not to mention, mother earth is not kind. If you go to more remote places you can find lines that have been around 60 or 70 years. Not going to find many underground lines that old. There's also the fact that adding capacity to overhead lines is easier in most cases, but that's a bit too nuanced for this post. And finally, electricity is pretty easy to move overhead. Water, oil, gas, and sewage are not. In most places the ground where it would make sense to bury power lines is *crowded* and most of those companies don't want high voltage anywhere near their stuff. Hell they don't even want the pole in the ground because most of the poles are grounded. But any company that will even let you bury near them is going to, at minimum, want an inspector on site while you build, and you get to pay his wages while he's out there. Most companies would rather take you to court than let you build though. So most of the time, high lines are where it's at! Edit: All of my experience is in North America. I don't know why Europe manages to get everything underground, but as I mention below I expect its a combination of denser urban areas and government regulation. Some places in the US are experimenting with that, but others probably won't for quite some time. /u/thekbob linked a great study here: URL_0 That goes a lot more in depth about why underground electric utilities are better at some things, and still unlikely to catch on in the states. Also, I may have given enough information for some really dedicated soul to deduce who I work for. For the record I am not an official spokesperson for any company, any opinions expressed here or in other comments are solely my own and do not reflect the opinions of any other entity.", "I work for a power utility contractor and we hear this a lot. Building new developments with underground power lines is easy. Before you put up the buildings, pour the asphalt for the roads, and plant the lawns, you can plan it all out and dig trenches to bury the electrical lines. It looks nicer, it's easier, and anyway, you're already digging trenches for water, sewer, gas, cable, etc... so laying another set of conduits in the same trenches isn't much additional cost. Look at most new master-planned housing developments, and this is how they do it. However, when you have a city that's already standing, buildings intact, streets covered with traffic 90% of the day, and water, gas, sewer, etc already crisscrossing underground, it becomes a lot more difficult to do. It involves getting easement rights from just about every land owner whose property you cross. It involves digging up existing streets, sidewalks, lawns, etc. It involves blocking traffic for several days to lay a couple hundred feet of cable. And then every transformer, switch, and other bit of equipment requires a bigger hole to be dug (some as big as 12'x15'x8' (4m x 5m x 3m ish for you metric folks). These require access manholes on the surface, vents, sometimes above-ground cabinets. More easement rights for these. Nobody wants a manhole in the middle of their lawn. So it's expensive. It's annoying to everyone in the area while the work is taking place. And while there are clearly benefits... there are downsides to underground power too. Vaults fill up with water and need to be pumped before workers can access them. If a segment of cable goes bad, it's much more difficult to test for the fault, pull it out, and replace it. And all of this work requires, again, traffic to be blocked, streets to be dug up and re-paved, all of the same hassles as installing them to begin with. And then consider the cost of replacing an existing overhead system with an underground one. Who pays this? The city? Fat chance. The power company? They're shelling out millions (billions) just on regular maintenance, hard to justify the cost of a project like this for dubious material benefits. The homeowners? Never gonna happen. And despite all this, it still does happen. Little bit by little bit, neighborhoods are getting converted across. Mostly it's suburban areas (it gets exponentially more difficult in tightly packed cities). Rich communities, for the most part. But to convert the whole country, even a whole major metropolitan area like Miami... would not be feasible, at least on any timeline not measured in centuries.", "Burial is expensive and not always practical. For instance, Florida is crisscrossed with waterways, so not only would you have to dig through the dirt you'd also have to sink the cables underwater, which is insanely difficult and expensive for every feeder line. Plus there are specific laws that cover underground burial, which are different from the laws covering aerial cables, because most people or businesses do t need the airspace but do utilize the land.", "Underground powerlines are only a solution for one problem. They mostly make sense when in a large metropolitan area where you've got conduits, and concrete/metallic sewers running throughout each building. Suburban areas have dirt, and are much farther away from switching stations, in order to replace the entirety of lines from above to below grade would require a tremendous amount of money, research of soils, and construction work to not only dig trenches, but also get civil utility planners out there to secure the ground space. For reference in Bellevue, WA; when replacing the power lines from above to underground for my apartment building, I needed to pay over 100k to service 4 buildings on the street, just for inspection, permits, and engineers. I then paid another 150k for the equipment, and the actual work cost another 60k, which required, yet another permit because it was in a city right of way. Since I was doing all that work in this area, I had to pay the entire bill. The work that they did afterwards was also pretty ugly, even though the lines were moved underground they still had to create a pole that stuck out from underground that fed to the existing buildings, because they weren't originally built with underground powerlines in mind. Update: Asked local power company and it usually costs nearly $1,000,000 per mile of power lines if you want them dug underground. Edit: 4 buildings not units.", "Some good answers but I'll add my two cents. The answer is actually quite complex, and you actually touch on a few points that dont talk about reliability. Source: Am utility engineer in Planning now and was designer for the distribution network. So true ELI5: Cost a lot of money, presents new types of challenges for future, causes issues when the power does go out, and no one wants to pay for it. And now the longer, probably still 5 year old version. Just a quick note for those not in the loop (after I wrote this whole thing). OH = Overhead. UG = underground. 1.) The biggest is typically cost. Burying a line is a ton more expensive. You need sand backfill, have to open the trench somehow which usually involved a hydrovac (especially in town) and pushing under existing roads. Plus underground wires need to be bigger than OH wires for a variety of reasons. Mostly capacity. A wire in the air has a lot of surface area and is exposed so it can cool a lot better. A wire in the ground is either in duct or direct buried and gets less cooling effect, plus there is an insulating material on the cable, further reducing it. 2.) Getting location to 'convert' from OH to UG can be sometimes impossible. The location of switching points (take those big green boxes the police hide behind to catch you speeding) are massive. You need lots of those, plus underground pedestals, transformers, convert everyones house from OH to UG. 3.) Any new customers, new growth or upgrades are a lot harder. Wires in the road in front of your house could be old and designed when no one had cell phones, computers, 17 TV's and AC. Now, even thought their more efficient, electrical use is going up. Add in electric cars and other components and the amount of work to rebuild an UG line for capacity and OH line is quite a bit more effort. 4.) Restoration is a lot harder. So sure, the power might stay on (assuming it doesn't flood, it has happened and they shut the power off anyways) but when there is a fault it is a lot harder to find. For underground we have lots of ways to detect faults, but worst case you dig up the whole cable you know has failed until you find the break. On OH it is a lot easier, you drive along until there is a pole on the ground. So while the reliability is up, it can translate into a longer outage. Most utilities are measured on two metrics for reliability. SAIDI and SAIFI. One is the standard average duration (so 30 minutes) and one is frequency. UG usually has a higher SAIDI and OH might have a higher SAIFI. 5.) Cost, everyone bitches about costs as it is. I'd suspect a 100% increase (depending on what all got buried, did we go back and replace all the old OH or just new to UG) to your electric bill to accomplish this. 6.) Electrical characteristics. This isn't as easy but USUALLY UG cannot carry as much, for as far, so in town it isn't an issue but rurals can be a problem. 7.) Some components that we have for OH are a lot harder to get or a lot more money on underground. Certain things like regulators we only stock OH ones. So you have to be creative where we put those pieces as it is. To specifically point out your question about burying in residential subdivisions. There are really three major components. 1.) The disappearance of the back alley. Most OH lines were run in back alleys. Most new URD's (Underground residential developments) no longer have back alleys. 2.) It is for aesthetics, either driven by the municipality or the developer themselves. 3.) Cost, since the ground is already all dug up to put in gas, telephone, sewer, roads, and foundation. Plus no one technically owns the homes yet, so no one can complain about placement of facilities, it is quite a bit cheaper than browfield construction. Hope I cover it, I am sure there are variations depending on region and my area is not prone to hurricanes, but I'd be happy to answer more questions or discuss differences further.", "Cost. It costs about ~~10~~ 5 times as much to bury power lines than to hang them overhead. Flooding also poses a risk to buried power lines, so that wouldn't be feasible for places like Miami, which is only 6 and 1/2 feet above sea level. So when comes specifically to a hurricane, when you're dealing with both high winds and flooding, there really is no guarantee that people will not lose power whether the lines are above or below ground. Edit: correction based on sources in below comments", "Planned developments/neighborhoods these days are often built on undeveloped land. They're going to have to dig for water/sewer anyways, and can lay electric/phone/coax/fiber at the same time. Since the developer usually owns the entire site to begin with there are minimal right of way issues. Cities have generally been around much longer, and are not developed all at the same time with a predetermined layout. This leads to lots of right-of-way issues and people with existing structures get annoyed when you try to dig through their properties.", "As this is my bread and butter I will answer however I won't go into too much detail as it will probably be buried. If this does end up gaining traction I will go into more detail or you can PM me. First is cost: Typically the average cost to bury a Main line primary feeder is about 3 million dollars per mile. This is just the Overhead cable not necessarily all the devices that allow it to go that far nor does that include secondary (which powers things normal consumers use like your house meter, street lights, traffic control signals and cell site equipment) Second is age: Please remember that in most \"established\" places electricity has been around for a hundred+ years and most anything pre 1990(excluding townhomes and certain subdivisions are fed overhead and to change it would be to require every homeowner to change their house configuration to go underground) and in alot of other places most of it used to be farmland and which brings me to my next point. Space. The amount of space need for the distribution system is mind boggling. Imagine Time Square in New York City. All the pretty lights and signals and billboards and stores are powered by something right? Well underground cables, but the amount of cable needed to provide that is sizable and so is the conduit that houses and protects the cable and the manholes that house the devices and allows people to work on them. Not to mention everything else in that street such as water, sewer, gas, fiber, cable, all of which also have mains and services branched off of the mains. Finally ease of repairs due to normal maintainance and damages. If we have a fault and even if we know it is between two manholes that are 200 feet apart. Well how do we know exactly where and how do we fix it. Tear up the road, pull the cable out an put a new span in? What if the conduit collapsed and we can't pull the new span and now we need to dig the entire road up and block traffic to fix it? Again OH is easier to see, easier to fix, easier to maintain and overall much more cost effective. However all that being said with better standards, materials, and technology putting it underground is becoming a more competitive option. Hope this helps!", "Everyone who is saying that overhead lines require more maintenance are wrong. They last longer than underground lines unless you get a lot of tornados. Water ruins those underground lines quick. Also, it is ten times faster and cheaper to repair overhead lines. The only time underground is really beneficial is in densely packed cities where space is at a premium.", "This fact hasn't been highlighted enough: The USA is huge!

It is WAY cheaper to string lines overhead than to bury them underground. Many Europeans don't realize how big the US really is until they try to travel here. Burying the lines just isn't cost effective in much of the US.", "Buried (No Pun Intended).. I don't have an ELI5 answer, but there is also an Engineering hurdle most people are unaware of. You can't just \"bury\" the cable without causing problems with the transmission of electricity, and potential damage to the cables themselves due to soil having wonky thermal properties. URL_0 \"Who could have foreseen that an electrical power engineer would need to be an expert at soil physics? Such knowledge is becoming increasingly critical, however, in the design and implementation of underground power transmission and distribution systems. Why? The issues are simple. Electricity flowing in a conductor generates heat. A resistance to heat flow between the cable and the ambient environment causes the cable temperature to rise. Moderate increases in temperature are within the range for which the cable was designed, but temperatures above the design temperature shorten cable life. Catastrophic failure occurs when cable temperatures become too high, as was the case in Auckland, NZ in 1998. Since the soil is in the heat flow path between the cable and the ambient environment (and therefore forms part of the thermal resistance) soil thermal properties are an important part of the overall design.\" Attempt to simplify: Power transmission generates heat. If you have cable exposed to the air, convection mainly solves your issue as there is plenty of air to help dissipate the heat and the overall environment is more predictable. If you bury the cable, the soil acts more like an insulator and can trap heat and damage the cable and/or make power transmission less efficient. This is compounded by the fact that soil is not the same everywhere and can be in various states that cause more issues (too wet, too dry, rocky, salty, sandy) and makes the situation less predictable and more expensive implement, service, and replace.", "It is expensive to install and expensive to maintain, especially if the city was built before household electricity was a thing. It is often cheap just to fix and replace overhead lines. Also, natural disasters can damage underground lines as well, and it is much harder to get power back up again.", "In addition to all the other answers given here: high voltage AC lines loose a lot of energy to the environment due to parasitic/stray capacitance. Think of the wire as one plate in the capacitor, and the earth as the other plate, with the air and other insulation as the dielectric. Also, a capacitor exists between each pair of adjacent lines. These capacitors charge and discharge once every half cycle, or 120 times a second in the US and 100 times a second everywhere else. So even minor losses associated with the charging and discharging of the capacitors will contribute significantly to power loss. Note these losses are greater with worsening dialectic. That is, worse insulation increase losses. Grid operators need to account for additional losses from a humid day. To give a quick overview, a capacitor can store more charge when you either increase the size of the plates (area in parallel with other plate) or move the plates closer together. The size of tje plates isn't going to change: the wire needs to run for the distance it does, so the length of wire being in parallel with both the earth and other wires isn't going to change whether the wires are suspended or burried however, if you stick the wires in the ground, you've now brought one \"plate\" of the capacitor much closer to the other: the earth. Additionally you'll likely need to take up a smaller footprint, so you'll likely need to bring the wires closer together as well. Of course, you'll need to use really good, really expensive insulation, but it'll be very difficult to overcome the additional losses of sticking the wire in the ground. Note at distribution voltages (under 40kV) this isn't really an issue, but at transmission voltages (above 100kV) it becomes a pretty big one. This is why you may hear about high voltage dc being used for transmission links where a line needs to be burried or put under water since you don't need to deal with the capacitive losses.", "As said cost is high. Another reason is safety. Look how many times cable or phones went out of service for a area as someone dug without marking or something was missed. Now imagine that happening with very high powered lines. Repairing lines that are up in the air is also easier than in the ground. Easy to find the issue and repair. If it was under ground they would need to dig before getting to it and that adds more complexity.", "FWIW where I live in DC the power lines are buried and once in a while due to heavy rain some underground box gets flooded, shorts due to environmental wear and tear, and the power cuts out. Point being that burying cables doesn't solve all problems and can introduce others.

At his company, the less-competent get stuck troubleshooting underground problems.

We still loose power when everyone around us does because the feeder lines get damaged.", "Hello! My job is to actually do exactly what you are talking about! I work for a firm which does the design work behind decommissioning residential power distribution and rebuilding it underground. The short answer to your question is cost. Much of the existing power infrastructure in certain parts of the US is very old. Many times the poles we scrap are from the 50's or earlier, have 'worked' so far so there hasn't been a need to spend on a huge overhaul. The cost of these projects runs into the millions of dollars and involves huge teams of people to manage property rights issues as well as the design, construction, management of the projects. It gets big and expensive quickly, and where the returns aren't really seen for years most of the time, it hasn't been as big of a priority. Now, however, there is a desire to improve reliability and decrease future maintenance costs by improving the grid via underground transmission and distribution.", "As someone who works in this trade and builds overhead and underground lines, I can ensure you having ugly wires above your head is alot better then underground. Underground takes twice as long to trouble shoot issues and twice as long to repair. When things are built underground it's normally because the contractor or customer is paying for it, or it's existing and more practical, like in a downtown area where it's harder to get equipment and big trucks in to set poles. That being said, if anyone is reading this I'm going to take the time to inform everyone, just because a wire is down on the ground does not mean it is dead. It's not like the movies. Sometimes it just sits there and it won't move a milimeter and it won't make a noise. If you see wire down stay away and call 911. If you are on a job site and have a dig in, just because you separated the cable does not mean it's dead. Stay safe hope this answers some questions and feel free to ask me anything.", "One. The power lines (in town high voltage stuff) isn't fully insulated. (pretty sure the distribution stuff doesn't have any)This is why trucks and cranes, balloons and hang gliders will create an arc when they touch them. It's not needed to fully insulate when it's high in the air, and it's easier to tell people to stay away. Burying the wire would drastically increase the size of the cable/wire, because you would have to fully insulate. Two. there's always water in the soil. In order to protect the people walking on the grass abouve, the wire would have to be fully insulated, and the conduit that is needed to protect it would also have to be water proof. Three. Mentioned in point two, the wire would have to be in a watertight conduit. The conduit would have to be large, (heat dissipation) . I wouldn't be surprised if the conduit was as big as 3~5ft for one line. There are three lines for every run. This makes for a bigger allocated space than water mains. Might be bigger than sewers. Four. You have to dig the trench. That means excavators, and trench boxes, which need to be installed and removed as you go. (for the workers safety) This is a long process. Time is money. more of a bonus point, than a genuine point. Five. If anyone digs, they will hit utilities under ground. Murphy's law. It doesn't matter if you have gps and lasers and drawings, and sonar or xrays.... Somewhere, sometime, someone digging a trench for a water line or internet or something will hit something that's already there. Having powerlines underground, means you could hit the powerline.", "The answer to any \"Why doesn't the U.S. do *x* with utilities is almost always that we are a massive country with a massive population spread over a very large distance. Any simple solution becomes much more complicated when you factor the sheer logistics of doing it on the scale necessary to serve such a large population over such large distances.", "Lineman apprentice here. Much easier to do the routine maintenance that occurs daily versus preparing for the one or two hurricanes that come in a year. Wire gets pulled down in a storm, you kill it at a transformer, splice the wire back together, fix the pole and turn it back on. Underground wire is safer in a storm but it's hard to work on every other day of the year", "I live in the northeast and there are two reasons: cost and frost. It's mostly rural roads here and burying all that wire is going to cost a _lot_. And then there's frost heaves, when two areas with different soil composition freeze, there can be a big bump in the ground that forms. These frost heaves will gladly tear a road to pieces and I'm assuming stress or even shear off any cable you put down there. The solution is to dig a whole lot deeper and fill with gravel and stuff, which goes back to cost. Coincidentally that's why the roads here get destroyed by a single winter, and they could be fixed using the same thing except the cost of digging up and redigging the road beds deeper would be way, way too much.", "I live in South Florida and was impacted by Hurricane Irma. Our power lines are buried but the power went out because the transformers and the electric substations are above ground.", "My city has partially converted to underground, but not completely. A few towns over everything is above ground, and the other direction is the opposite.

Also the ground very literally moves here. Like we are built on swamps and it would slowly move and break over time.", "Cost. Densely populated areas (e.g. city centers, concrete jungles) have manholes and cabling underground. Underground cabling is also more reliable in terms of not being susceptible to trees landing on them during storms and such. Reclosing (Protective function) on distribution lines with underground cabling is typically not performed due to this as an underground cable fault is not the type that will heal itself like effectively burning off a tree branch.", "Very simple answer. Cost and logistics of moving existing lines underground is the reason. New developments typically have underground feeds, but not older ones. The cost of moving them after the fact is very high, plus three are other considerations, like designing along the existing gas, water, sewer and other utilities underground. The U.S. really needs to invest in their infrastructure, and improvements to the power transmission system should be a top priority.", "As a mechanical draftsman who has had many opportunities to talk to electricians, I think one of the big things is the heat loads. Those lines give off a lot of heat which would obviously dissipate easier in open air than in the ground. Plus then you'd likely have to encase it in conduit and whenever something goes wrong you wouldn't be able to do a visual inspection, but would rather have to run system checks, followed by excavation, then reforming, tamping, etc. A lot of science goes into how those services stay put underground. My guess would be that the amount of repair needed to keep them in the air is offset by the huge cost of installation and maintenance of below-grade services.", "I work for a large electric utility in a major US city. A lot of the reasons why we don't have underground everywhere have been presented already. Now, the reason most powerlines are buried in a large metropolitan area has a lot to do with how it looks, but it also has to do with load. The system we use in the downtown area is nothing like the overhead system as it was designed specifically for a load dense area (a lot of electricity in a small area). Looking at pictures from before the underground system, the poles looked like a bird's nest with all of the wires and this was back in the 1910s. Our underground system is one of the oldest in the US dating back to the 1920s. To put things in perspective cost wise, in my area the average home has an electricity bill of $150-$200/ month. In the downtown area, it is not uncommon for customers to have a $500,000/ month bill with some customers exceeding $1M/ month. Not only do these customers pay enough to support the cost of the system, they are also in industries that require uninterrupted power. These customers are typically high rise buildings. A few years ago, we had to recable about 2 miles on one feeder that cost $5M. While this sounds quite expensive, the job payed for itself because it was supported by the customer base.", "I work as a utility arborist contractor for a major utility and hear this a lot. For one, To bury lines requires extensive engineering to take the existing utilities and put them underground. This requires locating countless other utilities and pipes that are underground and working around them. Lots of these also need replacing, which then becomes a major project as municipalities try to fix these at the same time. Digging is very expensive; its much quicker and expedient to put up a new pole. Only in new developments is it worthwhile to put in underground lines as the ground is still broken and there is nothing else down there that needs to be worked around. Also, trees have roots, and for property owners who don't like the way utilities trim around trees on routine maintenance (cause they think they \"butcher\" trees, digging tunnels through roots will invariably kill trees faster. Second, If something were to happen to the lines, such as a tree root or something breaks the insulation and water gets in, the time to repair and restore power is much longer than raising a downed pole and putting in a line splice. As bad as power lines are in a storm, it is very easy to locate the outage location (often a downed tree) on an OH system and repair it than it is to bring an excavation crew to dig up a faulted UG cable. To be fair, underground utilities SHOULD be more reliable than above ground, but the cost of installation + the cost of repair should something go wrong is the primary reason why we haven't put everything underground.", "First you have to understand that there are two types of power companys, coops and utilities. Coops are member run and owned; so each member has a vote in how things are run. Utilities are usually city owned business' that sell power, water, and gas; while coops only sell power usually. Another important thing to understand is that underground power is a newer thing. If you notice any new housing developments going up in your area you may notice that most of the power in the area is underground. It's because of the cost. It's cheaper to place underground in New areas then it is in older simply because these are new and there isn't a need to tear up each existing members yard up. Keep in mind that even though the company may do all the work we still pay for it all due to the hike in power prices they would require to pay for the workers and materials. The cost for these upgrades will always be placed on the co-op membership since technically the membership owns and runs the business and the majority of power company's in the US are co-ops. On the otherside we have Utility companies. You'll actually find that in a lot of places, especially here in Minnesota, will install new underground utilities as needed when they tear roads up to redo them. Again this is done on the city side so is usually handled when you get the old city managers who have run everything out and new ones in, that's when it began in my area at least. Utility companies who are city owned simply have to fit it into a budget they have. And as we all know government and budgets don't ever get handled in a way that's bennificial to the local population because of politics. So for the most part it is simply because your neighbors don't want to pay higher prices to cover the cost to set the new system up and on the otherside you have politics that prevent things from being done."]}
{"prompt": "Virtual Address Spaces\nAn elaboration of the question: Why does all code begin at the same \"fixed address for all processes\" in a computer? What exactly is a virtual address space? The figures I've seen of this don't really help me understand.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["ELI5: Processes can't directly mess around with the RAM the computer owns. The OS gives them a fake RAM to play around with as they please and behind the scenes manipulates the real RAM and prevents conflicts with memory the program cannot touch. The fake ram is called \"virtual memory\" and the addresses in it is the \"Virtual address space\". Eli10: All programs think they own the entire memory, apart from the little bit the OS reserves for itself. that means that in a 32bit system every program that you run thinks that it has unlimited access to 4Gb of RAM. The OS code is located on one end, the program code on the other, and then the actual memory the program manipulates is in the middle (along with some library functions and predetermined data the program needs). So, there are two things at stake: virtual memory and physical memory. The virtual memory is what the program, and by extension the instructions read by the cpu, works with. as stated, all programs think they own the entire RAM. They all start their execution in the state that every address, from 0x00000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF is under their control (barring the section the Kernel owns and is off limits). So if programs A and B both claim memory loction 0xDeadbeef they are both granted the request. This is called the virtual memory. The OS gives programs an \"virtual\" RAM, an imaginary memory they can do whatever with and not fear that they are messing with memory addresses other programs are using. Obviously programs don't own the entire RAM. The CPU has a special chip whose job is to translate from the virtual memory space into the physical memory space: It takes the address the program wants to access and translates it to the address the program actually is storing data. The program might request 0xDeadBeef and the CPU returns whatever is in 0xColdMilk"]}

Why a time over 0 to 60mph? the max acceleration varies a lot depending on your current velocity, so instead of giving a number of acceleration a time as a measurement of average acceleration when increasing the speed from 0 to 60 is more describing. Why stop at 60 and not 50 or 100? Probably because 60 mph is very close to 100km/h which is used in metric unit countries."]}

If it's a choice between keeping 100 young men employed all year in the military instead of on the streets, it's a better return of investment to fund the standing army than expensive weaponry. It's not simple. Putting all that ordinance (even setting aside an armed warhead) inside a fast flying missile is not something just any engineer can do. Just the MATH on it alone started early 20th century. Liquid propelled rockets first appeared in WWII and Germany was focusing a fortune (massive) on weapons research, it took quite a lot for them to even get the V2 viable. And at that stage, it was arguable whether it was a better investment than air dropping bombs from planes (certainly there was more risk of pilots and bombers dropping them from planes though). Modern rockets have to fly fast and accurately to justify the investment, due to most major countries having SOME form of missile defense. So they have to be state-of-the-art enough to have a chance to get through, again, expensive investment. The missiles require a small army of trained personnel, and support personnel, and a guarded facility that is maintained. So again, one missile might cost so much that you could be looking at FAR more effective things a country could be doing with the money, in terms of defense spending. When you have a big country that already has a huge military infrastructure and trained engineers and scientists, and they are determined to remain the big boys in the playground, they have to do that.

{"prompt": "Why does each system in a car require its own type of fluid?\nAn elaboration of the question: Like, why does a car's brakes need brake fluid specifically, and why isn't there some universal fluid that we could use in everything?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Brake fluid is subjected to over 5000psi and sometimes hundreds of degrees Fahrenheit temps Antifreeze (coolant) only has to deal with < 300 degree temps but must not freeze and must maintain a consistent viscosity no matter the temp and must be good at conducting heat. Transmission fluid must maintain a higher viscosity than either of those and constant strain and pressure Engine oil must maintain its lubricating properties from -50f to 300f and not break down. And not foam up in the process of being churned up by the engine. Windshield washer fluid must not freeze but can’t leave an oily residue on the glass Gasoline must ignite at the precise moment a spark is applied no sooner and no later. Gear oil in your differential must lubricate the gears without running off of them since they aren’t submerged in it. So it must be a heavy weight oil", "Because each system is independent and each fluid has different properties.. Let's compare it to your body and the different fluids in the different systems in your body. So you engine needs oil to keep the parts lubricated so they don't create friction, creating excess heat, and damage. The fluid also needs to be cleaned so it doesn't get thick and clog up the system. Our joints have fluid in between them to keep them lubricated and to prevent the cartilage and bones from scraping against each other. You need transmission fluid for the same reason you need engine fluid. All those gears need to stay lubricated so they don't degrade. You need brake fluid because your brakes use a hydrolic pressure system. When you step on the breaks, pressure increasses in the break lines to cause the break pads to clamp on the wheels. In this case it doesn't need to be a lubricant like oil. It needs to have properties that allow the transfer of pressure very quickly. You don't want a delay from when you tap the brake pedal to when the brakes activate. The closest system I can think of for this is blood. Our blood needs to transfer it's contents around the body very fast. The heart can be thought of as the brake pedal. Our blood pressure increases when there is increased demand for blood supply around the body. You also have antifreeze/coolant to prevent the systems from overheating in hot temperatures or freezing in low temperatures. This can't be achieved with wither oil or brake fluid. It needs to be easy to flow like water, but also be resistant to change in temperature. I guess there's no single bodily fluid that performs this task. But a variety of human fluids do like sweat, our kidneys, lymphatic system, and the thymus all work to keep the body within a certain temperature range. Then theres gasoline, this function is obvious. It provides the combustive force to power your vehicle. Neither lubricating oil, antifreeze, or brake fluid could do this. Gasoline is highly flamable and needs to be. The best analogue in the human body is food and the digestive system. Food is our fuel, the calories are burnt for energy. And I guess all that's left is windshield washer fluid. Obviously this is basically the same thing as windex. You wouldn't want to use this to lubricate your engine, and you wouldn't want to use oil to wash your windows. The best bodily fluid that matches this is tears. It keeps your view clean and clear. tl;dr Every fluid has specific properties that serve specific functions. The other fluids cannot meet the needs of all the systems in your car. If you tried to, you'd end up with either a substance that is mediocre at all of them, or you'd have a fluid that's good at one job and fails at all the others. Putting gasoline to lubricate your engine will cause your car to explode, and putting engine oil in your gas tank will ruin your intake valve."]}

The amount of external damage can be very small compared to the internal damage, misleadingly so, but there will always be some. And yeah there are a lot of things you look for.

If you see piles of debris, a lot of broken windows, huge cracks or the building is actually tilting, its best you stay away. For large buildings, they just don't let anyone go in until professionals can inspect the structure to see if its safe or not. With smaller structures and homes, you can have the people occupying it look for any obvious signs of problems, and make judgement calls until an inspector can get around to it (they'll be busy with more vital things like hospitals in the immediate aftermath, so it takes time to getto residential areas.)

{"prompt": "ohms law\nAn elaboration of the question: I'm getting into coil building for vapes and everyone says I need to understand ohms law and all I really know about it is how to spell it and it has something to do with resistance\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["V=IR. The voltage drop (i.e. the voltage your supply needs to be) across the resistor is equal to the amperage (i.e. the current that supply has to be able to put out) multiplied by the resistance of the resistor (which I'm assuming is a heating element, I don't vape).", "You need to look a bit beyond Ohm's Law (V = I R) in to Power, because Power is what will determine the performance of the coil. Power is the rate energy is being used, per second, which will determine how much vaporisation gets done per second. Say you take apart an existing vaper and do some measurements. You have the battery voltage and the resistance of the coil. From those you can get a rough power usage figure for the coil in watts, using the formula P = V^2 / R. Now say you want to double the power for some reason - I'm not going to ask why. That formula has certain implications: You could half the resistance, and the power usage would double. But if you doubled the voltage, the power usage would *quadruple*, because it's related to the *square* of the voltage. So you wouldn't do that, you'd increase it by a factor of about 1.4 (the square root of 2). This is ignoring questions about the performance of the coil itself, which other posters have touched on. In my opinion, more voltage over the same coil would overheat it, so increasing the voltage would mean you'd have to increase the length of the coil wire too.", "A lot of electrical things can be understood with an analogy to water. Voltage is like water pressure - imagine a dam holding a bunch of water back. That's like your battery. Resistance is how much the dam resists letting the water through. A battery that's not connected to anything has basically infinite resistance, and holds its charge. As soon as you connect it to a wire though, you've made a hole in the dam. The amount of water that flows through the hole is the current. Something with a very low resistance, like just a naked wire connected to both ends, is like a giant hole in the dam. Just as water would rush through all at once and cause a lot of noise, your wire will pass a lot of current at once and get dangerously hot. It's important to have an appropriate amount of resistance along your circuit so that the current goes through at a controlled rate to power your device. In your case, your heating element is kind of like a water wheel. You want enough energy flow to get it to work without overwhelming it. Ohm's law is the relationship between current, voltage and resistance and you can use it to ensure that you're getting the kind of flow you want. The current is always equal to the voltage divided by the resistance, or I = V/R, also stated as V = IR."]}
{"prompt": "Why is AC current better at long distances than DC?\nAn elaboration of the question: Searching the internet I found someone saying that the above is not true, yet (on his word) when my father studied engineering he was shown through experimentation how DC current would not reach the stated wire length which was instead met by the same AC input. Not sure what to think nor how it works.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["**AC power can easily be transformed to a very high voltage.** * By the equation P = U*I we see an increase in voltage (U) must lead to a decrease in current (I) for the same power (P). * With Ohms law I = U / R, we can calculate the power loss in a resistance (the cable) as: P_loss = R / (U²) or P_loss = R * I². In both forms in the second statement, we see it's beneficial to increase the voltage, and reduce the current. AC transformers exactly do this. DC transformers exist, but are still more expensive and harder to manufacture.", "If you imagine electricity like water for a DC circuit you have to push water from the start, through the entire system and then back to the pump, figuratively speaking. In an AC circuit imagine two pumps one to pull and one to push and they switch back and forth at 60 x second so the water only moves back and forth slightly through the circuit. So imagine yourself trying to blow water through a long hose to the other side that is DC. If you have two people one at each end of the hose each alternatively blow/suck water through the hose that is AC. Kind of since this is explain like I'm 5. Plus DC suffers from long wire resistance and other more scientific reasons that are not listed.", "The higher the voltage at which you transmit power, the lower the losses are going to be on the way. The reason behind that is difficult to explain without using physical formulas though. So power infrastructure uses very high voltages to transmit power over great distances, and transforms it down to more manageable voltages for local distribution, all the way down to the 110 or 230 V you get in your home. This is where AC has an advantage: You can feed an AC current straight into a transformer to increase or decrease the voltage, without needing expensive equipment and with minimal losses. DC current however can't be transformed, so you first need to turn it into AC current and then into a transformer, and then convert it back into DC. This makes the necessary equipment expensive and increases power losses, which is why almost all power infrastructure uses AC. But there is one disadvantage to AC: AC has slightly higher losses than DC at the same voltage, for reasons which again aren't exactly easy to eli5. When you have very long connections, these additional losses can offset the additional costs from converting AC to DC and then again to AC, which makes DC actually more efficient. So DC also has its uses in power transmission.", "AC is easy to transform up and down in voltage. This is important since current and voltage are inversely proportional and the losses is related to the current and not the voltage. So if you increase the voltage to thousands of volts you will have very little transfer losses. You might have seen demonstrations of AC and DC being transferred along the same lines at the same voltage showing less transfer losses with AC but that may easily be a misunderstanding of how voltage applies to AC. Since the voltage is constantly changing the amount of power transferred is not as simple as with DC. It depends on the power factor of your load and if you are measuring peak voltage or something else. For long distances AC does have some issues with the capacitance and inductance in the wires causing more transfer losses then DC. However this loss can easily be justified if you look at the equipment in each end required to convert between AC and DC for a DC transfer line. So high voltage DC lines are more effective but are generally only seen with very long distance undersea cables and generally between two power zones that use different AC cycles so you need to convert it anyway."]}

When it's on, it probably moves more water than the area is using so it would generate more pressure than the pipes can take if you just pumped water into the pipes. The solution, is to build a water tower. When the pump is on it pumps water into the tower. This makes the water level in the tower go up. When the tower is full, the pump turns off. Everybody always sees the pressure generated by the height of the tower above the pipes.", "They are basically big tanks of water on tall legs. The water is pumped into the tank, and then gravity pulls the water down into the system, although in some systems rain water is also collected. Usually the pipes to fill or drain the system are in the middle, but may be in the sides. The water may be filtered before and after, depending on the use. The gravity provides a consistent pressure without any equipment. This can provide entire cities with water pressure evenly through the plumbing by using pipes instead of motors. Pumping into the tank is far more efficient than trying to pump water to every eventual consumer of the water.", "The water is pumped from a well up into the tower where the height of the tower then creates water pressure to keep the water flowing through that community.

It sounds like a horrible idea to add exhaust back into the intake of and engine. Why do it?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["When gas is burned on its own without additives, it burns very hot. When it burns this hot one of the products of combustion is NOx, nitrogen oxides, which is a serious pollutant, responsible for smog and a main contributor of acid rain. The most notable previous attempt to cool the combustion was leaded gasoline, which lead to airborne lead and serious health and pollution problems.

By seeing how high they go, it's relatively simple physics to derive how far it could travel if it were launched at a conventional angle assuming you take into account things like air resistance and the curvature of the Earth.", "ICBM range is based on two major metrics: Thrust capability and payload. Thrust indicates how long the engine can burn for and how powerful the engine is. More thrust means longer range. This can be determined based on watching a rocket and measuring its size. Once you know its acceleration off the pad and how big it is (how much fuel it can hold), you've got all the information you need to calculate maximum range. Payload is a bit fuzzier, and also affects range. A heavier payload means the engine has to work harder to lift it (lowering range). Most experts can agree on the rough dimensions of a weapon that can go atop various rockets while still being 'efficient'. Larger warheads lower range too much, and lighter warheads won't do significant enough damage to worry about. Combining the two determines the effective range of the rocket."]}

Then when there is a force in the direction the shape is designed for, the incredibly strong fibers take a lot of the stress. This means you can make it stronger and lighter. If you're doing a force the structure isn't made for, it can actually make it weaker - because the fiber isn't taking any stress in the direction and can actually cause a failure mode.", "I think the resin is just to help it keep its shape, the strength comes from the fibers themselves.

{"prompt": "Why do cooling towers for nuclear power plants have to be so tall?\nAn elaboration of the question: And does there have to be two of them per plant is just one enough?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Thermal power plants need to reject heat, because not all the heat energy can be captured by the turbine/generator. The plants therefore need some sort of way of getting rid of the heat, called a heatsink. If the power plant is near the sea, or a large lake, then cold water can be used as the heatsink. If less water is available (for example the plant only has a river for cooling water), then another way of getting rid of the heat is needed. Cooling towers are an effective way of doing this. There are two main types - natural draft and forced draft. In both cases, they work the same way. Warm water is sprayed from spray nozzles high up. As the water falls down, some evaporates cooling the rest of it. The cooled water is collected at the bottom of the tower. In a natural draft tower, the tower is tall enough that the buoyancy of the heated air is enough to create a strong up-draft. Cold air is sucked in at the bottom, rises, and the hot air exits from the top. In a forced draft tower, fans are used to blow the air through the tower. These don't need to be very high, because they don't rely on a tall column of air. Cooling towers are designed according to how much heat needs to be removed, the temperature of the water, how tall the towers are allowed to be (there may be zoning restrictions on them due to how tall natural draft towers may be), weather conditions, etc. There are various models and equations that can be used to design the towers. It would be possible to build a single cooling tower for a power plant, even a high power nuclear plant; but it would have to be very large. For example, the new nuclear plants in Georgia have 1 tower each. (See photos at URL_0 ) The same design plants being built in North Carolina (now cancelled) were being built with 2 forced draft low-profile towers each.

{"prompt": "Engine Oil Ratings\nAn elaboration of the question: I know there are different standards to which engine oil is rated for gas, diesel, motorcycle/atv and I am wondering about effects of using let's say a car oil in a motorcycle or vice versa.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["This question has many answers. I can answer the car/motorcycle one with authority: motorcycles use wet clutches (engine oil lubricates the clutch). Most modern car oils have friction modifiers which decrease friction between parts. If you used oil with friction modifiers in a vehicle with a wet clutch (ie. almost all motorcycles) the clutch would slip, which is obviously pretty bad. You can use diesel oil in motorcycles no problem. One of the most popular motorcycle oils out there is actual a diesel oil. So a lot has to do with what kind of crap they're including in their product, since no oil is pure oil, they all have additives. The other stuff, like 5w-40, 10w-30 is temperature ratings.

It causes smog and acid rain, it harms the ozone layer, and it has all sorts of bad reactions with biological material. Unfortunately, it's also an essentially unavoidable product of engine combustion; when you take a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen (which is of course what air is), and you bring it up to very high temperatures, the N2 and O2 molecules end up reacting to form NOx.

What makes it to go off?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["It's pretty simple, really. A lot more simple than people think. When a window get smashed, you abruptly change the air pressure inside the car. There is a sensor somewhere inside the car that detects the pressure change. The same sensor reacts when you have a large dog barking inside the car too, so most car alarms have a setting where you can turn off that sensor either temporarily or permanently. Added to that, some cars have vibration sensors. They detect when the car is lifted, so that you can't steal the rims without the alarm going off. Incidentally, those sensors also react to things that are unrelated, like earth quakes or when a train passes by a poorly built parking lot. Then, to make it harder to bypass the alarm, it reacts when the car battery gets disconnected. Some alarms also react when you try to remove a light bulb (because, you know, if it ain't blinking people won't react quickly enough) and most of them protect themselves from short circuited lamps because that is one of the oldest tricks in the book to cull an old aftermarket alarm system. To top it off, the alarm often has its own battery so that it can run the siren independently from the cars electrical system for half an hour or so. The rest is about entry control. There is a switch in each door. Including the tank cap and the engine compartment. Sometimes you also replace the central locking motors with motors that are able to lock themselves, because that is also an old trick; if you can physically move the motor in the drivers door, it will typically order all the other motors to open.

{"prompt": "Different Types of Metal Strengths\nAn elaboration of the question: Hello reddit, I'm looking for an easy explanation for different metallic strengths(Yield, impact, compressive, tensile). Any responses would be invaluable.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["* Hardness: Scratch-ability. If it wears or rubs against another material, does it wear out or does the other thing wear out? Chalk is one of the softest materials, diamond is one of the hardest. * Toughness: How quickly it can absorb a lot of energy. Example: you hit it with a hammer: Not tough, it shatters (diamond). Very tough, the hammer goes 'clunk' (magnesium steel). Toughness is also called Impact Strength. Dropping your laptop is also an example of material toughness at work. (Protip: do not attempt) * Young's Modulus: Stiffness. Very low modulus means the material is flexible and can stretch (weak plastic). Very high modulus means the material is stiff and does not bend at all (tungsten carbide). Something that is very stiff but not strong is \"brittle\". * Strength: There are several varieties of strength but they refer to how much force can be applied THROUGH the material. The way to measure this is force per area. The area used is the cross section of the thinnest part of where the force will be pushing or pulling through the thing you're examining. Force per area is pressure, so strength is measured in Pounds per Square Inch (PSI), Kilopounds per Square Inch (KSI) and MegaPascals (MPa). * Yield Strength: how much force does it take for the material to begin to bend or stretch *permanently*. (As far as most designs go, most kinds of things \"are broken\" if they reach the Yield point. A bent screw isn't shattered, but it can't do its job properly any more.) If you press on a paperclip, the maximum amount of push you can apply BEFORE it actually begins to change shape is its Yield Strength. * Ultimate Strength: how much force does it take for the material to break into pieces. (Some materials, like rubber, don't have a yield strength. They just flex and flex and flex and suddenly fail.) Bending a ruler until it snaps is an example of ultimate strength for that ruler. * Yield Limit: how much force does it take for the material to bend or stretch, AND still be able to return to its original shape. (Example: squishing a plastic cup in your hand, but not to the point where it snaps the rim.) Different directions of forces have different names, and have different strength measurements associated with them. * Tensile - pulling. How much force does it take to pull a thing until it bends or breaks. * Compression - pushing or squishing. How much force does it take to squash a thing. * Bending - self explanatory. * Buckling - bending caused by compression of thinner parts. * Shear - cutting action, or being pulled and pushed at the same time near the same place in opposite directions It gets more complicated (i.e. worse) the deeper you go. I haven't even mentioned *plasticity* or *stress*, and forces can be far more complicated than just the five I mentioned."]}

I'm trying to get more electricity into my manufacturing plant, I had to apply to the power company for a review of the new connection. They looked at the existing capacity on my leg of the grid and determined that i can take another 200A of the grid (at13.2kv) without impacting the other customers. they told me this is good because my 2nd option would be to run 5 miles of utility poles and install a new sub-station. option 1 is about $100,000 while option 2 would be about $4 million.", "Water, sewer, drainage and cable are typically under the new roads.

{"prompt": "Neural Network vs Alpha-beta pruning\nAn elaboration of the question: What are the key differences between an 'Artificial Neural Network' and 'Alpha-beta pruning', in terms of how they function? What are the pros and cons for each?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["That's a hard question because you really comparing apples and oranges. The mini-max algorithm is useful in very specific situations. You need to have a well-defined state space (game board and pieces), well-defined state transitions (game rules), adversarial gameplay (players have opposing goals), low branching factor (few good moves in a given position) alternating turns, and a good static evaluation function (who has the most pieces). When these conditions exist, mini-max and its various heuristics (which includes alpha-beta pruning) is an efficient way to conduct a brute force search through the move tree. A neural network is an artificial intelligence technique that in some ways mimics the human brain. The network learns by being exposed to a large body of input and being \"rewarded\" or \"punished\" if its response is right or wrong. It is a very general technique applicable to a wide variety of problems but usually does not give as good results as a special purpose solution. The two are so different, comparing them is like asking what is a better food, grain or beef Wellington? Grain feeds the world, but you are unlikely to order it in a fancy restaurant."]}
{"prompt": "How does a turbo provide MORE power than it requires to spin?\nAn elaboration of the question: I know that a turbo uses the exhaust to spin a turbine to push more air into the combustion engine. But how can it produce more power then it requires to run? I can't quite grasp the concept, as it feels like the equivilant of me pulling my self up by a rope without a pulley. And where does the limit go, as you can't just keep adding more turbos to get infinite power?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Your exhaust gases are being forced out by explosive force during the combustion cycle. These gases are then harnessed by a fan. This does, in fact, create back pressure and would slow down the enough slightly. But, by using this waste energy, the turbocharger forces extra air into the cylinder. Your vehicle's computer reads the pressure of this air, and adds more fuel. If you add extra fuel to a normal r running engine, there are very slight gains, and then the engine will run richer and richer, which is very dirty and inefficient. Overall, the extra air pressure far outweighs the 'slowing down' effect from the exhaust back pressure.", "The turbo does not generate power, it's not a turbine engine. Rather, it's a device for cramming more air into the piston engine -- which uses this air to burn more petroleum fuel in the same-sized cylinder.", "Most people think that only the \"flow\" of air spins a turbo.. when in effect, most of the energy is from the HEAT of the air getting out of the engine.

{"prompt": "Why does some disposable lighter stop working before the gas runs out?\nAn elaboration of the question: My fruit for the day. Why does some disposable lighter stop working before the gas runs out? By stop working I mean: 1. Does not light up. 2. Lights up but with very small flame. On the other hand, why does some disposable lighter continue to operate until the gas runs out?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["A leaky valve can let some air in. That will dilute the concentration of butane fumes inside lighter, making it harder to ignite it. Butane is heavier than air so the air sits on top stopping so much butane escaping. Less butane coming out = a smaller flame. Depending on the design, you can sometimes tip them to get all the liquid in one side under the valve, which helps because the air moves to the empty side. Or give it a good shake which helps mix butane and air to make it easier to ignite."]}

If you're making a 1 kHz low pass filter then you want the gain for every frequency below 1 kHz to be as close to 1 (unity or 100%) as possible. A gain of 1 means a signal of that frequency will come out looking the same, if your input signal is only made of low frequencies then it will come out looking the same as it went it. You'd also want every frequency above 1 kHz to have a gain as close to zero as possible, this means they don't make it through the filter and aren't in your output signal In passive filters the gain is always less than or equal to 1, unlike in amplifiers where the gain is generally greater than 1"]}

{"prompt": "What difference does the layout of pistons in an engine make?\nAn elaboration of the question: eg. Two stroke, Straight 6, V6, W16 Does it have a significant contribution to power delivery?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["[this is more ELI9] It helps to think of a car (or any other piston-engined machine) like a bicycle. Each piston moves up and down inside its cylinder, sort of like your legs do when pedaling your bicycle. Those pistons, just your legs, turn a crank that connects to the wheels and makes the car/bike move forward. - In a bicycle, the pedals are located opposite to each other. In other words, one pedal is at the top when the other is at the bottom (i.e. 180°/180° orientation). This makes it easier for you to pedal smoothly. If they were both at the top/bottom at the same time, or some other orientation (e.g. 90°/270°), it would be harder to pedal, and you would get a more “lumpy” feeling, similar to how it feels if you try to pedal with just one leg. You’d feel a very pronounced pulse on every rotation. - The same principles apply in a piston-engined car; It’s convenient to lay out pistons in pairs that oppose each other. That gives you smooth and efficient power delivery. Unlike bicycles though, an engine can easily have more than two pistons (i.e. legs), which can give you a lot more power. Most cars have between four and eight cylinders, and sometimes up to twelve (16 in _very_ rare cases). You could arrange them like a tandem bike, but that takes up a LOT of space. Instead, engines usually arranges the pistons all side by side, as if bicyclists were sitting shoulder-to-shoulder (like in a paddle boat). This is called an “inline” or “straight” arrangement e.g. an inline 6-cylinder or I-6 engine. - That works well for four cylinders. It doesn’t take up a lot of space, and you get a nice and even 90°-90°-90°-90° orientation along the crankshaft. It also works ok for five cylinders, but you can imagine how awkward it is to have a one-legged bicyclist on your team. It works REALLY well for six cylinders, with a 60°-60°-60°-60°-60°-60° orientation that is extraordinarily smooth because each pulse is so close to the next. Unfortunately, that requires a longer crankshaft, which takes up more space in the engine compartment and makes the hood longer (or wider, depending on which direction you orient the engine itself). - To get around that problem, engines sometimes position the pistons across from each other instead of all in a line side by side. That modification takes up less space. Usually it’s in a “V” pattern (e.g. V6, V8, V12) with pairs of pistons arranged like `•’ around the crankshaft, and occasionally it’s an “H” pattern with pistons arranged like —•— (most notably Subaru and Porsche). V’s are narrower but taller (good tradeoff between packaging efficiency and smoothness), whereas H’s are lower but wider (great for handling due to low center of gravity, but tend to have more vibration/harshness). - If this were an ELI12, we’d go into the differences between different piston and crankshaft angles in V- engines as well as their resulting harmonic/vibrations, why different companies chose certain layouts, and maybe even talk about a few crazy W-shaped engines."]}
{"prompt": "How does electricity generation adapt to variation of power consumption?\nAn elaboration of the question: If I were to turn on my lights at my house, does the power generation plant work a little harder until I turn them back off? If so, how does it know? I know that storing a lot of electric energy can be very difficult.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Electricity has to be generated as soon as it is used, this means that demand has to constantly be matched to supply. There is relatively little storage in the grid. The basic way in which power is regulated is called \"frequency control\". Most large generators are rotating machines. They spin at the speed of the grid's electrical frequency (for a 60 Hz country like the US, this means they spin 60 times per second or 3600 rpm). Their rotation is magnetically locked to the grid. This means all the generators in the grid rotate completely synchronised. Generators become stiffer to turn as you take more power from them. If they are unconnected, they turn freely, but as you start to draw power, you have to work harder to turn them. So, imagine that all the power plants are in a stable condition, the engines for the generators are all at a steady power, and the grid frequency (generator speed) is stable and not moving. Now, a big factory switches on some heavy machines. The extra power being taken from the grid makes the generators a tiny bit stiffer to turn - Just like a car driving along the road and reaching a hill, when they see the load, they will start slowing down. The grid operator will see the grid frequency dropping, and will send instructions out to various power plants telling them \"please increase power by 10 MW\". Some plants may have automatic control, so the grid operator can give an automatic instruction like \"Adjust power by 1 MW for each 0.01 Hz that grid frequency deviates from 60.0 Hz.\" This is called \"primary frequency control\". It works, but you have to have power plants available which can respond quickly. The problem is that not all power plants can respond quickly - sometime it takes hours to get the boilers hot enough to get more steam. This means that the grid operator has to plan in advance. They can usually predict roughly how much electricity is needed at some time of day. For example, power consumption is much lower during the night. They also know at that 6 am, power consumption starts rising as people start going to work, factories start turning on machines, etc. So, they will tell slow responders like coal plants to reduce power over night, and the start increasing power in the morning; so that they are already producing power in advance. They then use frequency control on fast responding plants (like gas) to make fine adjustments. So, if there is too much power and frequency starts rising, they can tell the gas plants to reduce power to bring frequency back under control. The idea is that the grid operator forecasts how much power is needed at a specific time, and gets power plants ready in advance, but some fine adjustment is needed from second to second.", "The power grid is full of devices that \"store\" a (relatively) small amount of energy and ensure consistent, stable delivery of power to homes and businesses. This gives power stations (and switching stations, key word: grid) time to ramp up their power production in response to unexpected usage spikes, \"refilling\" this stored power. Many steam power plants also have huge flywheels which can help keep up with demand."]}

They don't have such a system, but satellite locations are tracked and new launches take these paths into account. Collisions are extremely rare due to the vast distances involved.", "As you said, space is the crucial component here. There's an awful lot of room and satellites are tiny. Additionally, orbits are by nature extremely predictable, satellites in high orbit will follow the same path at the same speed for millions of years. Satellites are indeed tracked and catalogued, and their orbits are calculated in advance in order to predict and avoid collisions - I don't know much more than that. I recommend reading about Kessler Syndrome - basically, if a collision does occur, satellites would tend to break apart into a sort of \"shotgun\" formation, further increasing the odds of additional collisions, which in turn \"shotgun\" and further increase the odds of collisions - it eventually corrects itself as eccentric orbits slow down and deorbit, but this happens on a very long timescale and this could potentially make space inaccessible to Earthlings for thousands or even millions of years. See Gravity (film), Planetes (Anime), Cowboy Bebop (Anime) Edit: I also want to add that several collisions have occurred in the past, at least two seem to be deliberately destroyed with EKV or some other weapon, and IIRC there was a collision involving an Iridium satellite which required the ISS to perform evasive maneuvers, and not for the first time."]}
{"prompt": "What makes a river like the Mississippi change course?\nAn elaboration of the question: I understand that sediment from upriver settles and causes the river to change course, but I just can't wrap my head around how the mechanisms for that actually work. It seems like before the sediment could come even close to clogging up the current channel, the force of the river would clear that sediment away. We can assume that we're not even talking about the man-made levees that keep the river controlled now. I just don't understand how starting a 'new' course would ever be more efficient for the flow of the water than even a slightly clogged but otherwise established course.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["A new flow does not have to be more efficient totally. Is only have to be locally easier to flow in a direction. A river can start to [meander]( URL_1 ). The only thing that has to happen is that the water flow faster on one side then the other. Then sediment will be deposited on the slower side and removed on the faster so the path of the river will move. If the meander is large the river can intersect in own path downstream and a [Oxbow lake]( URL_0 ) is formed where the river no longer flow. So a river change course not by a sudden clogging of the old path but by a slow move of its path. There can be a sudden change if the land in not even and the river eroderad away natural dam and flow down to a lower land area", "Water has to be traveling at a certain speed to carry sediment. If you were to take a jar of water + fine sand, and swirl it around, you'd observe that before the water stops moving entirely, it's slowed down enough that the sand starts to settle at the bottom again. So up the river where it's just coming out of mountains and is still taking a steep course, yeah, the water just flushes most of the sediment on. But when the river reaches a flat area before the ocean, it slows down a lot. This slowing causes it to deposit sediment. Some parts of rivers may lose less than a foot of elevation over a mile of their course. In places like this where it's only a very slight elevation difference that's causing the river to flow in the first place, enough sediment can land that it makes some other slightly-sloped course more sloped. That's when the river's course changes. Some rivers, like the Mississippi, have to be dredged and propped up with levees to force them to keep the same course we're used to, because river has \"wanted\" to take a different course for a long time."]}

{"prompt": "what is the difference between a compressed carbon dioxide tanks and a liquefied carbon dioxide tank?\nAn elaboration of the question: As a bit of a background story, where I work we can only use liquified CO2 for frozen drinks otherwise we would have to have our pipes flushed and machine cleaned/repaired. So what is the difference and what is compressed CO2 used for?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The saturated liquid pressure for CO2 at room temperature is about 860 psi. As such, major gains in storage efficiency are made when you bottle it at higher pressures than that, because it will exist in mixed phase in the bottle. There is much more CO2 in a volume of liquid than in that same volume of gas. Now, mixed phase liquids / gases like that, with the appropriate equipment, can either be drawn off as gas (where e.g. the system pressure is immediately reduced to produce a gas stream), or with a dip tube or submerged outlet, drawn off as liquid at the bottle pressure, where the CO2 is either consumed as liquid or has its pressure dropped somewhere downstream to be consumed as gas. Depends on the equipment and the process. As you consume a product from such a mixed phase bottle,, the pressure in it stays constant. You just drop the liquid level, and some of the liquid evaporates to maintain the saturation pressure. That's why things like CO2 and propane are filled by weight. The pressure won't begin to drop until all of the liquid is exhausted and only gas remains. CO2 in particular can also be solid near atmospheric pressure, if you cool it sufficiently (i.e. dry ice), and you might notice if you ever discharge a CO2 fire extinguisher that you get a few solid flakes coming out of the nozzle with the gas - this is just CO2 that has cooled too much during discharge and solidified - not a problem though, as that state is short lived and quickly reverts to gas again as it warms. It sounds like your particular process requires CO2 as liquid, either for dosing, or for ensuring a particular temperature change when it is evaporated. Compressed gas CO2 is simply CO2 stored at a lesser pressure than the saturated liquid pressure, ensuring that it is all gas, and enabling you to measure remaining contents with a pressure gauge."]}

Construction vehicles have enormous torque to be able to move heavy loads, but don't move quickly. Horsepower takes this a step further by measuring torque *multiplied by engine speed*. This gives a somewhat more useful measure for cars, because it represents an engine's ability to apply its torque over time. Two cars might have the same horsepower, but one achieves it through higher engine speed with lower torque, while the other achieves it through high torque with lower speed. Generally, smaller engines have less torque but can rev higher, while large engines have more torque but cannot reach such high speeds.", "Okay, lots of wrong answers in this thread. tl;dr at bottom. Torque is how much twisting (technical term: angular) force something exerts. In the case of a car engine, it's basically how hard the engine is trying to speed the car up (or, specifically, how hard the engine is trying to twist the axles, which is what makes the car move). In the case of brakes, it's how hard the brakes are trying to slow the car down. If you know Newton's Second Law, \\*force = mass × acceleration\\*, then the rotational equivalent of force is torque. The reason that we talk about torque rather than force is because when you want to spin something, where you apply force to it relative to the axis makes a big difference. For instance, with a lever, the farther away from the fulcrum you apply force, the easier it is to make it move, but the slower it goes. Torque accounts for this by saying that something that makes something spin the same amount is the same torque. So the closer you are to the axis (the center you're rotating around, like the fulcrum of a lever), the more force you need to produce the same amount of torque. It's similar to how we measure the speed that a wheel is spinning in rpm (or another similar unit) rather than in how fast any individual part of the wheel is moving. Forces only exist when they cause or prevent change of speed, and the same is true of torque. More force is required to accelerate something from a standstill, because you have to give it all the inertia of motion. But once it's moving, you only need to apply enough force to counter drag and friction to keep it moving at the same speed. So a car that's cruising at speed is not actually applying all that much torque; the engine would put in the most torque if you press the pedal down all the way from a standstill, or if you slam the brakes. Horsepower is a measure of power, which is difficult to explain fully without first explaining work. Work is \\*force × distance\\*, and measures how much energy is transferred from the source of the force into whatever is moving. The faster something accelerates, the higher the force, so over the same distance, it will do more work. This works out, because the resulting speed is higher, so the moving object has higher energy. Work is really unintuitive at first, because of how muscles work. Muscles consume chemical energy to exert any force, even just to hold something up. So you shouldn't think of work as how hard you have to strain for something. A better example is a building: a building stays up because, even though gravity tries to pull it down, the forces that hold it together counteract gravity. They don't need to keep spending energy to do so. And since nothing is moving, the total work done by gravity on the building is 0. Power is a measure of how quickly energy is transferred. The SI unit of power is the watt, which is the same thing we measure electricity with, and that helps understand it. For instance, if you use an electric heater, then the wattage determines how much electrical energy can be transferred into heat per second. More wattage means you use up more energy in a given amount of time, but get more heat out. Horsepower is a different unit of power, but measures the same thing (the exact definition varies, but is usually around 745 W unless you're measuring steam engines in which case it's about 9800 W for some reason I can't explain). When applied to motion, we already have \\*work = force × distance\\*, and then we have \\*power = work / time\\*. But \\*distance / time = speed\\* (ignoring the technical distinction between speed and velocity), so \\*power = force × speed\\*. In the case of a car, the power is the speed at which the car is moving, times its speed. In order to exert the same force on two objects, you have to transfer \\*more\\* energy on the one that is moving faster. Remember that the transfer of energy and the force are not the same thing. If we want to talk about torque instead, the same thing comes out once we account for rotational speed (which, again, we measure in units like rpm), we get \\*power = torque × rotational speed\\*. This might seem a bit weird, but the reason is fundamentally because of the fact that kinetic energy (that is, the energy of something moving) is not linear. If you have two objects of the same mass, with the first traveling twice as fast as the first, then the first object actually has four times the kinetic energy than the second. The reason that this has to be true can ultimately be traced down to relativity and to the fact that the laws of physics don't change over time (as far as we know, anyway). But it's also why something traveling twice as fast hitting you can hurt more than twice as much. This means that the power output of the engine limits the top rotational speed of the drift shaft coming out of the engine, because at some point it is already spinning so fast that the engine can't output enough torque to do anything more than overcome resistance. From there, the drive train and wheels (most importantly the gear ratio, but wheel radius plays an important role as well) affect the conversion of torque into forward force. There is a tradeoff between force and speed. In a low gear, you get high torque but a low top speed, which is perfect for accelerating at lower speeds. In high gear, you get lower torque, so the engine has a hard time accelerating the car, but in exchange it can keep it up at much higher speeds. tl;dr Torque is how much force is applied to accelerate or decelerate something spinning. We rate car engines with torque, not force, because car engines work by spinning an axle (or multiple axles). Horsepower is how quickly the engine can transfer energy into moving the car. While it depends on other factors, and the drive train is super important, the horsepower is the ultimate limiter on the top speed of the car. Torque affects how fast the engine can accelerate the car, more torque is faster. For two engines of the same power but different torque, the one with lower torque will have a higher top speed but lower acceleration. The gearbox lets us convert between torque and top speed, though, so then a lot of the distinction comes into the kind of gears needed. EDIT: Talked about drive trains and the role of gears and cleared up the summary, thanks to u/constantino1's reply.", "Torque is your how hard you're spinning something. A quarter takes less torque than a table to spin around, and a table takes less torque than a large rock to spin around.. Horsepower is how fast you're spinning that thing. Rotating a quarter 10 times per second means more horsepower than rotating a quarter 1 time per second. But having a large rock spin 10 times per second is more horsepower than that same quarter spinning 10 times per second because the rock requires a larger torque to spin. Contextually in vehicles, a lot of engines produces approximately the same amount of torque. But certain engines due to design can get up to higher RPMS, and therefor have much larger peak horsepower values. Take for example a V twin chopper vs. a 4 cylinder sport bike. The V twin probably will often produce more torque within it's range, which maxes out around 5-6k RPM. A 4 cylinder sport bike may produce less torque and thus accelerate slower, but because the engine can get up to 10k RPM, it has higher horsepower on paper.", "Just think about a game of Streetfighter. Zangief = high torque, low horsepower Chun-Li = low torque, high horsepower. Both can get the job done, lower torque needs applied more often to get there. Edit: more words.", "Do not listen to alle the people claiming torque is important in engines pulling a huge load. The only thing that matters is the horsepower curve, and thanks to the modern invention of the \"gearbox\", you can choose the torque at the wheels with the gearing.", "I guess because you've used the word \"horsepower\", you're only getting answers about cars. Horsepower is a unit of power output that can be used to describe any source of work over time - it is not limited to cars. That is to say that power describes a force applied to move an object over a given distance and time. Power can be measured in horsepower or a number of other units. Torque is a twisting force, or a force applied at a distance from a rotation point. They differ in that power is related to time, whereas torque is not.", "Horsepower is power, ideally measured in Watts. I assume you are talking about a car or something similar, so in this case we are talking about mechanical power, but it is the same as electrical power. It is a measure of the rate at which energy is exchanged. Torque is measured in Nm, and it is the force that is acting on a rotating object, in this case the axle of the car. By definition the horsepower is the product of the Torque and the rotating speed(rpm) of the object. It is important to note that you can achieve the same horsepower with different torques as long as you have different rpm. That is what the gearbox of a car does. The engine provides a constant amount of power(horsepower) by rotating the shaft at a certain speed (rpm1) with a certain force (torque1). When you need to go uphill, you need addtional force, so the gearbox use gears of different radii to lower the rotating speed of the wheels (rpm2) and so obtain an higher force (torque2)."]}
{"prompt": "How do modern computer clocks oscillate so fast?\nAn elaboration of the question: I see clock speeds of 2 or 3 GHz - how does the computer actually generate these clock speeds internally?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Clock references in modern computers are generated from quartz crystals. Quartz has a special crystal structure which allows it to be piezoelectric, meaning small physical stress on the crystal will be converted to electricity (charge) and visa versa. We exploit this by designing quartz crystals to have a resonance at a precise frequency, then apply a small amount of electricity to stress the crystal, which will then output an oscillating electrical clock frequency at its resonance. Quartz is extremely accurate over time and temperature and very cheap, making it an ideal reference. Many other technologies have been researched over the years to generate clocks, but quartz remains a \"miracle\" material for this application because of its incredible accuracy and low cost. Quartz is a fixed clock however, so a phased locked loop (PLL) circuit takes the extremely ideal reference from the quartz to generate an arbitrary clock frequency, the 2-3 GHz one you described. This also is the circuit that adjusts when you \"overclock\" your PC. Assuming a very well designed PLL (not necessarily trivial), you are only limited by your reference accuracy, making the accurate quartz clock the key to high frequencies.", "Oscillating fast is not hard to do. You can connect 3 inverters in a circle and create a [Ring oscillator]( URL_0 ). You need 6 transistor to that. A inverted convert a 1 to a 0 and a 0 to a 1. If you connect 3 in a row you can start with the output as 101. The third is connected to the input of the firs and they change to 010 and the back to 101. You have not created a oscillator. They work because it take some time for each inviter to switch when the output of the previous change so you get a signal that change value around the loop. So the high speed is not a problem. The problem is that the time delay is depend on the temperature, voltage, and random variation in the manufacturing process. So the problem is to have a oscillator with the correct frequency that is stable. A common way to do that is a [phase lock loop (PLL)]( URL_1 ). You have a voltage controlled oscillator that you can build with a two operational amplifier. They done have a fixed frequency as the ring oscillator but you can control them with the input voltage. The PLL design uses a external reference that can be a crystal oscillator. You have a Phase detector that ouput a signal when the reference and generated clod is different. That in combination with a low pass filter can be the input to the voltage controlled oscillator with the result that the generate frequency is the same as the reference. To make a higher frequency clock you put a counter on the loop back. If the counter need tow clock tick before the output change the result is voltage will be set so the voltage controlled oscillator generate a signal of twice the frequency of the reference. The clock signal of a computer is generated like that with a crystal oscillator as a external reference and multiply the frequency with a phase lock loop and a counter."]}

To ELI5, electrons bond weakly with metal, and can move along the metal from atom to atom much more freely than they can in many other substances.

{"prompt": "How does HEAT rounds work?\nAn elaboration of the question: I have read numerous explanations on it and i still don't understand. I'm talking about high explosive anti-tank rounds in case you are wondering.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["So, you want to penetrate / do damage to something that could be miles away, how do you do that? In general, there are common several tank rounds- AP - Armor Piercing - The most basic type of shell. It's a hunk of material material that uses its kinetic energy to attempt to penetrate armor. It's was cheap, was 'effective', and got the job done when tank designs were basic and were more similar to heavily-armored cars than they were tanks. Early tanks had armor thicknesses as thin as 7mm, compared to later tank designs such as the Tiger 1 that had 100mm. HE - High Explosive - Not normally used against tanks, but the shell was used against infantry, reinforcements, or buildings. It's a standard shell that explodes once it contacts a surface, it generally doesn't penetrate, and hitting another tank with it would certain daze the crew, but likely not knock them out. [APCBC]( URL_2 ) (and other similar shells) - Armor Piercing Capped, Ballistic Capped Shell - These rounds came about because the angle at which a shell comes in determines if it will deflect (or bounce) off the armor, or impact it. With standard AP, it was found that by creating armor that was sloped (called sloped armor), you could cause an incoming shell to \"bounce off\" and deflect, rather than penetrate the tank. This slopped design is seen to great extent with the famous Russian T-34 tank. This caused the rounds to ricochet instead of penetrating. To remedy this, they designed a shell which would be able to \"[grip]( URL_6 )\" the tank upon impact. Think of it like giving an armor piercing more of a grip to impact at a better angle, and lower the chances of ricocheting. [APCBC-HE]( URL_14 ) - Armor Piercing Capped, Ballistic Capped, High Explosive- This round features the outside design of the APCBC shell, but was considered to be extra lethal, due to the High Explosive part of it. So you design an armor piercing shell that can penetrate a tank, but what happens after it does? Well, you have hot toxic fumes enter the tank, scraps and chunks of metal flying inside, but it would not necessarily knock the crew out. So how do we make it more lethal? Let's make it **explode** after it penetrates, of course. After penetrating, this shell would detonate after traveling a certain short distance. This would create a dangerous pressure-explosion inside the crew cabin, and would likely kill most of the crew if the explosion itself doesn't outright. One shot kills were common, as was setting off the ammunition inside the tank, which would cause the tank to explode. [HESH]( URL_11 )- High Explosive Squash-Head - A very interesting type of explosive, in general, it works by \"squashing\" a high explosive compound on the surface, and then detonating it. The goal is not to necessairly penetrate, but to rather cause an effect called [spalling]( URL_0 ). It would cause the other side of the armor to blast outsides towards the crew, and create many small tiny pieces of steel throughout the crew space, penetrating the crew itself. It functions similar to HEAT, in that the velocity of the round doesn't affect it's killing potential, but rather the angle and if it makes contact well enough for it to stick that matters most. [APFSDS]( URL_12 )- Armor-Piercing-Fin Stabilized-Discarding Sabot - This is the latest design. A dense kinetic energy penetrator round is used to defeat composite armor from a great distance away. Speed kills armor, and if you concentrate enough kinetic energy into a single point you'll be able to go through thicker armor (This is also the principle behind HEAT rounds, discussed below). The fins are used to prevent the round from tumbling in air, and the sabot is used to ensure the round fires as straight of a path as possible once fired out the barrel, but once its traveling it's discarded to prevent drag from slowing it down. [HEAT]( URL_8 ) - High Explosive, Anti Tank - This round came about as more and more tanks began using thicker armor. Creating larger shells to penetrate thicker armor wasn't scaling well, because the larger the gun, the larger the tank needed to be, and the heavier it had to be. Instead, we can concentrate all that energy into a single point, because that is all we need. HEAT rounds are shaped charges, which focuses kinetic energy (it doesn't \"melt the armor\") towards a single point. It's the kinetic speed of this jet that penetrates the armor. A good thing to remember is that speed negates armor. The faster something is traveling, the greater the armor-penetrating effect will be. A metal ball traveling at 5 miles an hour won't break through 100 mm of armor, but a metal ball traveling at 33000 miles per hour will break through it like it wasn't even there. That is how HEAT rounds penetrate, it uses a shaped charge that creates a jet stream of liquid metal that is traveling at ~25k miles an hour. At that speed, it \"slices\" through the armor and into the cabin, creating a stream of molten metal that travels into the crew cabin, potentially knocking them out. It's not the temperature of the HEAT round that causes it to penetrate, it's the **speed** that molten stream of metal that causes it to. Counter-measures- Tanks employ several measures to counteract new shell designs. It's fascinating learning about a new shell design that came around, and how armor changed as a result. [Sloped Armor]( URL_5 ) At first it was sloped armor, they found that 90° armor designs (such as the famous Tiger 1 tank) were ineffective given the fact that it used 100mm of steel, and provided 100mm of protection. But if you were to angle that armor 45 degrees, then the amount of protection increased (correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe it would be sqrt(2)x100, giving us 141mm of **effective** armor). Rounds that would normally penetrate a flat 100mm plate of armor would not penetrate, and the likelihood that a 140mm steel penetrating round would penetrate either, because of the fact that it's at an angle of 45° instead of flat 90°, which may cause it to bounce. The downside of this is that you need more armor total to cover your tank, so it's not just a straight up benefit. If your armor was 45°, then you would need sqrt(2) more armor to cover the same distance if it was flat. [Extra armor]( URL_4 ) - You'll notice in the [Tiger 1 tank]( URL_3 ), that there seem to be things sticking out from the front bottom of the tank. This is actually a piece of tank track, which was put there for two reasons. The first is to provide a backup of a section of tank track in case they become damaged. The second (and the reason why it's actually there and not elsewhere), is because it increased the distance that a shell would have to penetrate the tank. That section might be many millimeters thick, which meant that even though it wasn't designed to stop rounds, a round that had an explosive cap would detonate on that instead of the surface of the armor, meaning the likelihood of success of it penetrating to inside the tank greatly decreased. Nearly every single element of a tank design is for functional, rather than stylistic reason. Tigers [Anti-Spalling]( URL_13 )- As said before, spalling creates tiny fragments of metal that travel throughout the crew space, potentially killing crew members. To counteract this, you can install Spall-liners which would \"catch\" the metal spalling, and is placed in between the steel armor and the crew space. Kevlar can be used for this for example, and it used for body-armor as well. [Spaced Armor]( URL_7 )- Note the metal sheets on the sides of the tank. Spaced armor is useful in creating a gap between the penetrating shell, and the steel armor. The gap may detonate the ballast cap of the shell, and may cause the armor piercing shell to tumble before it hits the armor, greatly reducing the penetrating effect. It also causes HEAT rounds to detonate their shaped charge early, which greatly reduces that concentrating effect of liquid metal against the armor. [RPG's]( URL_9 ) are basically mobile HEAT rounds (note the distintive cone shape of the head). [Reactive Armor]( URL_1 )- So you have an incoming round that is likely to penetrate, and you want a last-minute ditch effort to try and slow it down. This is the thinking design behind reactive armor. If a paper airplane is coming towards your face and you have nothing but your mouth to prevent it from directly hitting you, what could you do? Well, you could try to dodge, but if you can't, the next best thing is to blow against it, that is what reactive armor does, it \"blows away\" an incoming shell by creating a secondary explosion that causes the incoming shell to lose energy. If I have a force of say 5 units, and the reactive armor pushes back with a force of 3 units, the total force against the armor would only be 2 units, which is far better than having 5 units of force, and at that point, my composite armor will likely protect me. [TROPHY/Arena countermeasure system]( URL_10 ) - This is a high-tech system designed to detect incoming rounds, and \"shoot\" them out of the sky before they have a chance of hitting the tank. Currently, Israel has the Trophy System, and Russia has the Arena system, but both work in the same principle. They intercept incoming rounds with either a \"shotgun\" blast to deflect/blow up the missile, or a mini-rocket to intercept and blow up the incoming projectile. And that's the post limit. Hope this helped and you learned something.", "Iirc HEAT uses shaped charge copper penetrators. These work by setting off a high explosive behind a metal (in this case copper) dish. The shape of the dish as well as the properties of the explosion combines to convert the solid or powdered metal into a stream of liquid or vaporized metal moving forward at many times the speed of sound. At that speed, tank armour stops acting as a solid as, simply put, solids only stick together at the speed of sound (in that material), so when an impact happens faster than that the impacted atoms have no time to convey that impact to their neighbours, and thus they're moved aside with relatively little energy required. This allows the molten copper, and possibly a secondary charge, to enter the interior of the tank and mess stuff up. Obviously any human hit by it will be grievously wounded or killed, while hitting a tank shell can set it off (killing everyone), and as mentioned some anti tank rounds have a secondary charge (I think I heard somewhere though I could be completely wrong) which is basically a small explosive that flies/falls through the hole the penetrator just made and then blows up (killing everyone). Edit: The Slow Mo Guys did a [video]( URL_0 ) using shaped charges recently (along with quite a lot of det cord and other explosives). Worth a watch just to visualize how fast shaped charges fling copper, as well as the holes they make.", "HEAT rounds work similar to an EFP. I'll compare HEAT to AP to help explain. An AP round is just a specialy designed projectile. It relies on the velocity of the round when it leaves the barrel to penatrate armor. In its simplest form it is like throwing a rock through a piece of paper. HEAT does not rely on the velocity of the round when it leaves the barrel instead the round has an explosive charge behind a metal liner. When it hits the target the charge explodes turning the metal liner into a jet of molten metal and projecting it through the armor. To put it in a super simple way. It's kind of like the HEAT is a tiny gun that you load into a bigger gun. You shoot the tiny gun out of the big gun and when the tiny gun hits the target it fires its little bullet at point blank range into the armor."]}

What's usually meant by \"aerodynamic shape\" when talking about droplet shaped objects is the reduced pressure loss drag and not their stability.

This has 2 effects. 1 rotating objects tend to resist changes to their rotational axis. Much like how a yoyo is stable when spinning. 2 any asymmetries in the bullet shape will not change the bullet path in a particular direction. The asymmetry is spun around the bullets axis and will cyclicly produce the same forces in all directions so that they cancel out and the bullet path is stable. Bullets can also be drag stabilized. So additional drag at the tail end can actually be desired to increase stability. If the bullet starts to fly sideways the tail end will get hit by the oncoming wind. This results in a force acting on the tail end of the bullet which pushes it inward and the bullet will return to its orientation along the direction of the flight path."]}

This little pipeline can bend and turn through all the nooks and crannies of a plane's frame and deliver that pressure wherever it needs to be. There's a device at the end of the line (slave cylinder or hydraulic motor) that converts that pressure into force and/or movement to operate a device like an engine throttle, or flaps, or brakes etc. Finally, the shape of the master and slave cylinders make a difference.

And nowadays they can also use electronics / motors; push the button and a motor pushes the wing surface. Hydraulics are used in brakes and power-steering in cars, in various industrial machines (bulldozers, etc.), and in airplanes and other vehicles. The advantage of hydraulics is that if you already have an engine that provides main power to the car or airplane or whatever, you can attach a hydraulic pump to the engine and \"borrow\" power from it, so you can gently touch your brake pedal, and the engine power will compress/pressurize the hydraulic oil and deliver much more power to the brakes or to the wing surfaces than your weak foot could achieve.

{"prompt": "Wouldn't the best place to build a space elevator be on the North/South pole?\nAn elaboration of the question: I thought, one of the reason that we haven't built a space elevator is due to the limitation of current building materials, not being able to withstand the speed in which the very end of elevator will be going. So why not build it on either pole? Wouldn't that be less stressful on the materials?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["A space elevator is useful because it is held taught from the end being thrown out by the Earth's rotation. At the poles this won't happen. As such you would just essentially be building a really tall tower, which is *much* harder.", "Placing such a project near the equator would enable the orbital momentum of a counterweight to keep the structure supported in space. Placing such a project on the poles would lose that benefit, and the entire weight of the structure plus reaction forces (not countered by deformation of the structure itself) would have to be supported by the base of the structure. So by changing that design, you largely turn an issue of a material not being able to withsrand huge tensions into a matter of surviving massive compression and a huge bending force.", "Those would be the worst places to build space elevators. Space elevators rely on the centrifugal (yes, im gonna call it centrifugal!) force to throw them out and away from the planet."]}
{"prompt": "How does a fuel pump and regulator work in an engine. (Mainly bike engine)\nAn elaboration of the question: As the title says. How does it all work?

Edit: I get the general idea of it but why and how and what does it do/help do?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["First of all, there are many types of fuel pressure regulators. Basically when close the pressure goes up and when open the pressure is released back to the fuel system. Example... Let’s say that A electric fuel pump is capable is pushing 80PSI at “X” volume.... the current “X” engine requires 45PSI to start and idle.... ——this is the tricky part—— The injectors used in this application have to be able to maintain a spray pattern in order to maintain the proper fuel ratio needed for that engine... if the fuel pressure is low the injector may drip instead of spray.... As the driver attempts to accelerate, the injector need to spray more fuel to increase the engine speed. now the fuel pressure will drop because the injectors are more “open” than in idle.... now the regulator “sees” the drop in pressure and attempts to compensate rising the fuel pressure to 45 or higher while the engine still under load; and once the load is gone adjusts back to 45PSI. Hope this help a little I just remembered, there are certain engines that do not use regulators at all but the fuel pump are fine tuned for the changes as needed."]}
{"prompt": "Why are tires filled with air instead of being solid rubber?\nAn elaboration of the question: Wouldn't this be a solution to flat tires?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Pneumatic tires come with several benefits. The first is cost. The materials are more expensive than the manufacture. Weight. It is incredibly fuel inefficient to get wheels that heavy - as solid rubber tires, rotating. It's even harder to get that much weight to stop. And the steel wheel would have to be thicker, the breaks larger, or we'd have to go back to drum brakes on cars, which are themselves more expensive and dissipate heat less. All that weight puts additional strain on the drivetrain and breaking system. Traction. Since the tire is solid rubber, the face can't deflect - flatten out to increase surface area contact. This reduces traction. Wear. Such large and heavy masses, rotating at high speed, I'm not sure the tire could even hold itself together. Even if it can, what do you do once you wear off the tread? Do you put new tread on top? Do you cut new tread into the existing rubber, and wear the thing down to a nub like an eraser? Do you replace the whole wheel and recycle the materials? & #x200B; Pneumatic tires are also part of the suspension, since they act like a spring. The whole point of the suspension is to keep the rubber on the road, and make the ride comfortable. A solid rubber wheel, you would feel every rock, every crack, every \\*leaf\\*. And pneumatic tires can deflect around small surface imperfections.", "Because driving a car with solid tires is a very shaky, unpleasant experience. Imagine rising a bicycle with no tires; it would be like that.", "Don’t forget about the weight of a solid rubber tire. That would be a significant increase to an automobile. Rubber is pretty heavy.", "You answer was covered pretty well (weight, suspension, expense, heat dissipation), but I thought you might appreciate this article: URL_0 Turns out - airplane tires are pumped up with more pressure than a car tire to increase its strength.", "Some tires are solid rubber, it depends on the needs. They can carry greater loads and resist punctures. However, they are heavier, and provide less comfort (transmit more bumps). Additionally, they heat up more significantly, and flex less, which can contribute to faster degradation.", "Why is nitrogen filled tires a better thing than air tires? Or was that just clever marketing I read at the auto shop?", "We have solid tires we even use fluid filled tires in industrial settings where you need to use machinery to lift a lot of weight.

{"prompt": "How does engine angle in a “V” setup change the characteristics of the engine?\nAn elaboration of the question: For example, is a V 90^o better for torque than a V 60^o ? Edit: I mean the cylinder bank angle, not the rotation of the engine itself.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["None of the answers really do justice. There isnt any difference in the bank angle with regards to power or torque. Balancing the engine at different bank angles is different but doesn’t mean one angle is necessarily better/worse than another. The biggest reason is packaging. Fitting the engine in a specific sized engine bay will dictate things, the type of valve train changes the head size and the spacing requirements. This is why you see so many solutions in industry from inline cylinders, 30 degrees in some front engine V6’s. 60 degrees in others, 90 degrees in American style V8s and even 180 degree flat boxers. All different solutions to the packaging problem.", "Not the power. But proper bank angle will make a balanced running engine vs unbalanced rocking engine. V8 are best at 90deg. V6 at 60degrees. Reason is that there is sideways momentum because the connecting rod is opposite of the crank counterbalance so there's a pendulum swing effect when crank is rotating.", "The 90 degree angle is the most common and has the best balance, but the wide, heavy engine also needs an internal cam-pushrod-rocker assembly (and the low redline that comes with it) or a complex and heavy dual overhead cam system. Narrower angles do find use in some racing and specialty applications because they can be thinner and lighter, or even run on a single overhead cam. They're unbalanced though, and will rattle themselves apart over time without extra balancing mass."]}

Still wondering how clutch works, watched some YouTube videos but still can't get it. & #x200B; EDIT: Thanks for the help guys, appreciate em\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["[Transmissions]( URL_1 ) have many gears, so they can convert the spins from the engine into faster or slower spins of the wheel. When you switch gears, you need to disengage some of the gears, and engage different gears; the gears disengage / engage by making contact with each other.

{"prompt": "How is power restored after an outage caused by damaged poles or power lines?\nAn elaboration of the question: Near my home this morning, a car crash occurred at an intersection, and a power pole was hit and split in half. The power company said there were power lines in the road. This caused a power outage to about 1300 people. After about an hour, crews had restored power to those affected by the outage, but they said that they still needed to repair the broken pole and equipment. If they didn't fix the pole yet, then how was the power restored?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["They fixed / replaced the wires that were broken, and strung them up between the poles that were left intact, with perhaps a temporary pole or suspension wire to hold them in place until the full sized permanent pole is ordered and placed into the ground. A residential area is also a \"grid\" (that's why it's often called the power grid), which means that there are multiple connections available and they can re-route the electricity much like they re-route cars to go on alternate roads until the main road is re-paved or whatever.", "So there are a 2 ways that this can happen. 1. Temporary line failure- when an object is obstructing the line such as a branch falling on it or something like that. The line itself is not immediately damaged and service can be restored once the obstruction is removed. Newer power lines have special sensors that can shut off the voltage in a line section if this happens, so that the line doesn’t burn out. 2. Permanent failure- when the line itself is damaged and must be repaired or replaced to restore power to the line. Caused by the line burning out or being torn down in a storm. This method of failure will take longer to remedy. However, in both cases power is restored by rerouting power from other lines. It is easier to picture from a drawing but I will do my best here. In general, power lines are very redundant and can be routed in many different ways to accommodate different electric loads. Think of it as train tracks with the power being the trains. At any given time, the tracks are oriented so that each track is continuous, but the tracks can be realigned at certain junctions to allow trains to transfer to a new track. If a section of the track is damaged, anything farther down that track can not be reached by a train. But then the track next to it is switched later on down the line so that trains from that track can transfer and reach the original destinations of the first track. By rerouting the trains, only the damaged section can not be reached by the trains. The tracks will stay in this orientation until the track is fixed, then it can be returned to normal. In your particular case, your power was likely not directly attached to the damaged section so you were able to receive service from a different power line that had been switched. There were probably some folks who had to wait until the power line was fixed because they were directly attached to it."]}
{"prompt": "Can a mason jar valve work for something like hyperloop?\nAn elaboration of the question: cars, trains compress air when traveling, could we use something like a mason jar valve so we release that pressure thus having lower than atmosphere pressure in a vacuum tube?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The mason jars works as a one way valve. If the pressure inside the valve increases above ambient pressure the air is released into the atmosphere so that the pressure in the jar drops to ambient pressure. However if the pressure inside the jar drops to under ambient pressure the valve seals shut. Normal tunnels do not usually have these types of one way valves. There are usually ventilation shafts in the tunnel which will equalize the pressure. So when a car or train goes past the air will first rush outwards and then rush back inn when the train have passed. If you were to use a one way valve in the ventilation shafts then the valves would shut as the train passes. This does keep the pressure behind the train at slightly lower then ambient pressure. This will slow down the train and create extra drag as the vacuum sucks the train backwards. And as the tunnel is not sealed the air will just find other ways to enter and the pressure will equalize when the next train comes along. & #x200B; The hyperloop concept is a fairly old idea that people have been working on for decades. The idea is to seal the tunnel and make it into a vacuum chamber so that you have lower air resistance. There have been small scale \"rocket sled\" experiments but nothing bigger. There will likely be some one way valves to prevent the pressure from going high in a catastrophic event. However during normal operation the pressure in the tunnel will always be far bellow ambient pressure in the air. So the one way valve will always be shut."]}

{"prompt": "How does a bomb suit protect a bomb technician during an explosion?\nAn elaboration of the question: Edit: Thank you all for the responses. They very very clear!\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["There are three big dangers that typically come from a bomb explosion: heat, shrapnel, and shockwave. A bomb suit is designed, as much as possible, to protect from those three things. It's got thick layers of padding and kevlar to keep shrapnel from the bomb from piercing and harming the wearer. It's thermally insulated so that heat can't get inside the suit and burn the wearer. And it's got layers of material with a high acoustic impedance and soft foam layers to keep the shockwave from exerting too much pressure on the wearer. The shockwave is the biggest danger to the wearer if they're close to the bomb, and the hardest to protect against. A light suit can protect very effectively from shrapnel and heat, but might not be able to withstand a close-range shockwave that could still cause a lot of internal damage. Heavier suits are more able to withstand that pressure, but it's the hardest factor to protect against.", "The bomb suits are not magic force fields. A large enough bomb close enough to the guy wearing it will still result in injury or death. However, bomb suits do offer a large degree of protection. They protect from light fragmentation and heat as well as reducing the blast overpressure experienced by the wearer. In addition to the testing these suits have undergone, bomb techs have been blown up while wearing them.", "Thick kevlar and padding both help to stop shrapnel and dampen the shockwave, but not by much.

They use robots more now, but guess how often those robots work? For $200k you'd think it would work.

{"prompt": "How does a Total Containment Vessel, or 'Bomb Truck', work?\nAn elaboration of the question: Other than just being 'really strong', how are they designed to withstand an explosion in such a confined, sealed space?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Their main goal is usually to contain the shrapnel that an explosion would cause. They do this by disappating the energy of the explosion and shrapnel. On the inside there are layers of materials like kevlar that catch small debris and layers of metal to stop/break up larger debris. The outer shell of metal being the last layer to stop anything that gets through. All these layers spaced out is what tends to make these devices large and bulky. They also can't completely seal. An explosion creates a lot of hot gases that want to expand and containing the gases leads to big shockwave and more debris so the bomb vessels would need a way to vent gases so they don't become the bomb themselves.

{"prompt": "What is the reason why cars are made FWD/RWD?\nAn elaboration of the question: How do car manufacturers choose between FWD and RWD in their design? Is there a reason behind that?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["RWD cars are good for performance, because when a car is accelerating, its' inertia pushes weight backwards, which gets caught by the shocks into essentially transferring that mass down onto the back tires (regardless of what wheels are driving the car), leading to greater traction for straight-line acceleration. FWD cars are typically lighter, and thus more fuel efficient. AWD cars give you the best handling, but you add a lot of weight because you have 3 differential systems instead of the typical 1. They're also typically more expensive due to the added parts, and wear tires faster in everyday driving conditions. FWD cars also tend to not oversteer (your typical fishtail-type skid), and will understeer instead (you keep going somewhat the way you were going before turning), and are less prone to losing grip overall, which makes them favored by inexperienced drivers (more experienced drivers who routinely push their cars to skids tend to prefer oversteer, though.) Typically, FWD cars are going to be your economy models that are focused on saving fuel, and your newer standard sedans. RWD cars are going to be more sporty cars, and AWD cars are going to be either higher-end performance cars, or certain wagons/sedans made to do better in rain/snow/etc.", "Like most decisions for a car design (or any consumer product really), cost of production and intended audience play the biggest role. The goal, in simple terms, is to minimize cost of production, while maximizing interest from the intended audience. As a car company, you want to add features that add value to your audience, and nothing else. No one will pay more for features they don't care about if a more affordable option that forgoes them exists. In order to understand which drivetrain to include in a car, let's compare the advantages and disadvantages of each. FWD: Least expensive to produce, maximizes interior space (no transmission tunnel necessary), cheaper to maintain (fewer and smaller parts), tires last longer (rear tires almost don't wear, can rotate more frequently), higher fuel economy (less weight, possibly lower drag), provide more control in wet pavement. However, it's has poor weight distribution (front heavy), poor traction in turns, worst traction while accelerating forward, worst breaking performance. RWD: Excellent weight distribution, higher power capacity (as drive shafts and transmissions can be made larger and more robust), simple (transmission is usually separate from differential and drive shafts), great acceleration in straight lines, good breaking, best cornering. But it's more expensive to produce and maintain, robs the cabin and trunk of some room, generally less efficient (as the rotating assembly is heavier) and offers poor traction in wet/snow. AWD: Best traction in any condition, redundancy in case of driveline failure, predictable handling. However, it's the heaviest configuration, most expensive, most complex, requires most room, has worst efficiency. So, if your audience is comprised of working class families, you will add different features than if you're appealing to young enthusiasts. These are things like interior space, low cost of ownership, good fuel economy, reliability. In this case, FWD is unquestionably the right choice. If you want to sell a go anywhere fast car, than AWD is probably the right decision. If you want to sell a small high performance car, RWD is the best choice. The same process can be applied to transmissions, interior features, size, pretty much any voluntary design aspect of the car. TL;DR: Companies want to spend the least amount of money possible to make an attractive car. A family will be attractive as a FWD. A performance car will be more attractive as RWD."]}

The only way available in space is by radiation which is why the ISS has giant radiator fins in order to cool their ammonia coolant.

There is also a benefit to keep the device in the aircraft in order to record details right up until the moment of impact. To resolve this the Navy has 2 devices in the aircraft, an ejectable device, and a non-ejectable one. It's also important to note that flight data recorders are remarkably resilient devices so the benefits of ejecting the device would only be to speed up recovery, but that can also be accomplished by adding a homing beacon to the device itself.

One weekend at a particular machine, someone put 20's in the 5 compartment and it spit them out to several lucky people before Monday rolled around and the error was discovered. Surprisingly, when they tracked down those who had used the machine, no one mentioned having any issues."]}
