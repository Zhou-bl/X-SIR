    "Why is it so hard to completely prevent clipping of 3D models in video games?\nAn elaboration of the question: To be clear, I know nothing about programming or 3D graphics. Naively, I would think you could just give objects some property by which they cannot pass through each other. Yet I see some degree of clipping in almost every big studio 3D game. Why is this so hard to fix?\nHere is my answer: ",

    "Why has Tesla's work on 'Free Energy' never been fully explored or completed in the modern day?\nAn elaboration of the question: Surely by now someone or some company with the funds and resources would have taken on this task as it would revolutionize society put fossil fuels to bed? Is it due to the money being made by fossil fuels? or is there more to it?\nHere is my answer: ",
    "One Way Mirrors\nAn elaboration of the question: One way mirrors seem like a really common concept, seen in things such as classrooms, experiments, or even sunglasses. So how do they work?\nHere is my answer: ",
    "Why are semis that carry liquid cylindrical, and not rectangular?\nAn elaboration of the question: I was riding my bike down the road and semi carrying gasoline went by, and I thought, \"why not make a rectangular container, shouldn't it hold more liquid?\". Knowing I don't know anything about that stuff, can someone explain to me why we don't use rectangular semis for liquid transport?\nHere is my answer: ",
    "Why do boy bikes typically have a bar across the top whereas girl bikes do not?\nAn elaboration of the question: And that carries over from kids' bikes to bikes for adults. Just seems to me that, if anything, given human anatomy it would be reversed. Edit to add: Thank you all for pointing out that women/girls traditionally wore skirts in which that bar would present a problem. So, I guess two better questions would be: 1. Why is it still common? 2. Why do male bikes have that bar at all?\nHere is my answer: ",
    "If coaxial is good enough to get the signal inside, why do we use all kinds of other connections (HDMI, Ethernet etc...)\nAn elaboration of the question: Had some new services installed in my home recently and realized that they used coaxial cable for every service (TV, phone, Internet). I remember coaxial always being used for the TV, but it used to be a cable that just went straight into the TV. Then it changed to a cable going in a box that then hooked up to the TV. Now its the same but the box connects via HDMI instead of coaxial. Internet same thing, coaxial runs into the modem and then uses ethernet cables after that. Phone has its own modem which also then uses regular phone like jacks and connectors. But if Coaxial is what is importing all these signals into the house in the first place, why not standardized everything to run through coaxial inside the house as well?\nHere is my answer: ",
    "How does my car know if it is icy outside?\nAn elaboration of the question: My car can tell me the outside temperature AND whether or not it is icy. What sensors does a car use to determine if ice is possible? Does it detect moisture and compare it with temperature?\nHere is my answer: ",
    "In the winter, when we 'heat up' our cars, what is going on mechanically that is actually better for the car than driving it immediately?\nAn elaboration of the question: I've always had this perception that the internal machinery would sheer and wear more or break under stress in cold temps, is that basically correct?\nHere is my answer: ",
    "How has the steering wheel/accelerator gone basically unchanged throughout the automobile's history while most everything else in a car has been updated or changed?\nAn elaboration of the question: Is our current method of steering really the most efficient way to do it or is it just a case of wanting to keep the familiar?\nHere is my answer: ",

    "How can an autonomous (self driving) car work in adverse weather conditions? (Snow, ice, etc)\nAn elaboration of the question: So I get how these cars can work on nice dry/wet pavement, but how can they work on ice or snow? How can it sense the ridge of death slush when changing lanes on the freeway? Knows it needs more potential stopping distance from sliding in snow? Not slide off on a turn, or see through some fog? Everyone says they're coming sooner than we think! (Only if you live in a southern state, perhaps).\nHere is my answer: ",

    "Why do screws/bolts/nuts get loose and have to be tightened, in the first place?\nAn elaboration of the question: It happens so often, you have a mechanical problem because a bolt holding two things together has become loose, letting something wiggle around. But how do they become loose? It doesn't ever seem there's any pressure on the join in the direction that would cause a screw to turn, but they're always farther down the threads than you left them.\nHere is my answer: ",

The rounds from the guns appear to explode around the same height as the plane with the occasional one hitting a plane. What determines when the flak round will explode, what causes the round to explode, etc.\nHere is my answer: ",
    "Why are radiators often located beneath window shelves?\nAn elaboration of the question: Seems to me like more heat would escape the room when the source is located in the least insolated part of the room, which furthermore has less mass to retain the heat than a wall. Or is my science incorrect? Please explain\nHere is my answer: ",
    "Why aren't cars more fuel efficient?\nAn elaboration of the question: The small Japanese family cars of the 1970s were pulling 30-40 miles per gallon on carbureted, naturally-aspirated engines that had to be throttled to produce any performance. Yet today, with direct injected, turbocharged, electronically managed engines, fuel efficiency remains pretty similar. What gives?\nHere is my answer: ",
    "Pipeline regulations\nAn elaboration of the question: I understand oil spills are detrimental to our environment but so is transferring oil by truck.

    "How do transistors work and be the size of a atom?\nAn elaboration of the question: I don't really understand how transistors work. I read they are like doors, if they are how is that any different then a switch? How can transistors be so small and still function, I read we can make single atom transistors and even subatomic transistors. Bonus question: I could be wrong but it seems the vacuum tube turned into the transistor. Are they wired and function the same way but a transistor is just smaller. Like moving from wires to PCB or entirely different.\nHere is my answer: ",
    "why do you need a GFCI receptacle in wet places when it provides the same function as a circuit breaker?\nAn elaboration of the question: The magnetic part of a circuit breaker should trip when there's a short circuit. I fail to see how this is any different *in effect* than a \"ground fault\". Is it just the matter of it taking a few microseconds longer to react than a GFCI, or what?\nHere is my answer: ",

    "what the benefit of using a buffer?\nAn elaboration of the question: I'm reviewing some python code here and I'm wondering, what's the deal with a buffer size? Why is this convention useful? For reference this is the code: def main(): buffersize = 50000 infile = open('olives.jpg', 'rb') outfile = open('newfile.jpg', 'wb') buffer = infile.read(buffersize) while len(buffer): outfile.write(buffer) print('.', end='') print('Done')\nHere is my answer: ",
    "Why does such an important feature as a planes transponder not work like the planes flight data recorder and be much harder to turn off and have it's own backup power supply?\nAn elaboration of the question: I understand the FDR can be removed from the planes power supply by removing the circuit breaker, but it will then use it's own local power supply. Why does the transponder seem have a less strict \"up time\" policy applied to it by it being able to be turned off and having no localised power supply?\nHere is my answer: ",
    "How do weather radars generate a top-down view of clouds when they're on the ground?\nAn elaboration of the question: I think of a radar like a flashlight, where it shoots out a beam and whatever it hits, the beam bounces back. But with a flashlight, I get huge shadows behind the things I'm looking at and can't extrapolate this view to a top-down view. I can't see the burglar hiding behind my ottoman no matter how hard I squint, unless I move my position. So then how does a fixed-position radar build this top-down view? How does it discriminate between the front side of a cloud, the back side of a cloud, the sides of the cloud, the sides of the cloud behind that, etc.? Right now in my area there are like hundreds of layers of clouds just in one direction. I look at the map top-down and I can see how a radar could figure it out from my earth-orbit POV, but the radar is on the ground, not in space. I can't imagine every beam is able to report its complete itinerary back to the station like \"I bounced from position A to B ... to Z and then finally back to you for good\"...so how does this work?\nHere is my answer: ",
    "what in the audio jack\u2019s design makes the iPhone more prone to water damage than the lightning port?\nAn elaboration of the question: One reason that\u2019s cited for getting rid of the audio jack on smartphones is that the audio jack makes them especially vulnerable to water damage. But there are other orifices on smartphones, too. On the iPhone there\u2019s the lightning port millimetres from the audio jack. How is the lightning port doing better when it comes to water damage?\nHere is my answer: ",
    "Why are huge buildings concentrated in dense central areas of almost all major American cities and not more spread out?\nAn elaboration of the question: They are almost always concentrated in a downtown sort of area. Why is that? Why aren't they more spread out? Wouldn't spacial competition and property taxes make more of a case to locate larger structures away from one another? Not to mention cause less congestion traffic and commuting wise since less people work in the same area.\nHere is my answer: ",
    "How do we navigate on other planets?\nAn elaboration of the question: I'm been thinking about this question for some time. Today on earth we rely heavily on GPS to navigate around or via maps created with satellites or drawn by hand (ancient). But as we (hopefully) get to explore space and visit other planets, I guess we will need some new tool to navigate around. I guess putting satellites around the planet is one way to do it but imagine it won't be cost effective or great way to spend resources if we intend to get around ;-). Will we use the stars (like when first went out to sail) or will we send probes to map the planet or what? How do the rovers navigate on Mars?\nHere is my answer: ",
    "What's counter torque and why is it needed to make a helicopter fly?\nAn elaboration of the question: I once asked someone about how propellers can make an object fly.

    "How does the accelerator pedal in cars work?\nAn elaboration of the question: I have two theories in my mind but they can be both wrong. 1st theory: When the pedal is pushed a little, the car accelerates and then remain at a certain constant speed if the pedal is maintained at the same position. If the pedal is pushed further, the car accelerates and then remain at a higher constant speed as long as the pedal is maintained at the same position. 2nd theory: When the pedal is pushed a little, the car keeps accelerating at a slow rate and speed keeps changing at a slow rate. If the pedal is pressed further, the car keeps accelerating at a faster rate and speed keeps changing at a fast rate.\nHere is my answer: ",
    "How does a jet engine provide reverse thrust when landing?\nAn elaboration of the question: I searched but didnt really find a proper explanation (though i may be using the wrong terms) I look out the window and I see that the shrouding of the engine kind of folds back to the outlet of the jet and I guess maybe redirects it forward... Ok... but isnt all of that air its redirecting being sucked in from the front to begin with? So even if the redirection were 100% efficient (surely not) it would be a net zero thrust? So where does the reverse thrust actually come from? bonus question, how much good does it actually do? I mean... seems like it must be a fair amount of complexity and weight on the aircraft, plus the token amount of fuel, to shave a few feet off the landing distance? Wouldnt it be better to just let the existing brakes do the job if the runways can contain it? (or cant they?)\nHere is my answer: ",
    "How do sailboats / ancient ships steer if the wind isn't blowing in the direction they want to go?\nAn elaboration of the question: Forgive me if my terminology is off.

Ok, I know it\u2019s not magic, but how do the machines know what tokens are theirs? Also those generic eagle tokens that a lot of arcades use, can they be used at any arcade that uses them? This all assuming you can even find an arcade that still uses generic tokens, or tokens at all, these days. Same question with slot tokens, but I assume the answer will be the same.\nHere is my answer: ",

Is there anything that goes into them other than scientific data?\nAn elaboration of the question: Looking into buying a home and studying flood plain maps, it seems that the streets are in the 100 year plain, while the homesite is in the 500 year plain, for blocks and blocks... This creates a funny pattern that just doesn't seem right. Last time I checked, water doesn't discriminate on where it flows.\nHere is my answer: ",
    "How does a database handle 1 billion users?\nAn elaboration of the question: I'm really interested in how companies store such HUGE amounts of data but somehow retrieve and display the information in < 1s. I was looking at my Facebook activity for 2010 and it has the thousands upon thousands of posts I liked. You can't possibly store this in some sort of pivot table database, could you? Facebook would have literally 800 billion rows. And my actual question is, how does a company, like Facebook, store more than 1 billion credentials? Is it split into regions like Users_GB, Users_US? I work as a web developer. But as I work for a small company, I just can't fathom data this big. Any insider knowledge, anecdotes and discussion from anyone who works on large databases would be appreciated. Edit: Went to bed, woke up and the blew up.

    "Why is the current in a series circuit with multiple loads constant throughout the circuit? How do the electrons \"know\" to send less current in a circuit with more loads?\nAn elaboration of the question: My teacher explained this concept using Kirchoff's Current Law: since all the current entering a load must come out, a series circuit cannot have different currents in different parts of the circuit. Here's where I get confused: If I hook up a 5V battery to a 1 Ohm resistor, I get 5A of current in my circuit. However, the moment I add another 1 Ohm resistor \"downstream\" of the first resistor, I get 2.5 A of current everywhere in the circuit, even \"upstream\" of the first resistor. Since I'm thinking about this with the water analogy, I'm confused by how the battery \"knows\" that there's an extra load and it better send only half the current. Essentially, I guess my question is how the electron flow automatically changes to fit whatever load is in the circuit.\nHere is my answer: ",

But i'm almost 100% sure that no suit or armor we can currently produce will protect you from a landmine at point blank range. What are those suits for, and how effective are they? Also, they don't have any gloves? Are you just expected to get your hands blown off? Edit: Thanks for all the responses!

I recently got a BMW X3 and found out that the recommended mileage before getting an oil change is around 15K. This lead me to ask: What is it about the design of the German vehicles that allow them to go longer without changing the oil? Does the engine run at a slightly temperature than American models? Does it have to do with the fact that I am combusting higher rated gasoline in it(requires premium)? Do they use a superior oil filter?

But what I read from now is that most of the \"complicated\" things were about launching and space manoeuvers (like the CSM and LM docking process). Most of the missions before Apollo 11 even just circled around the moon without landing, and I can't figure how they knew they would have to adapt to an environment that different from space. How did the engineers from NASA (and also soviet Russia, they must have thought about it too) knew what \"being\" on the moon would be like? What it would need to descend/ascend, gravity, environment, temperatures... Did they have precise data of it or was it more about safety and redundancy?

    "Why is it that only hatchbacks/SUVS have a rear windshield wiper when they're the ones that need it the least?\nAn elaboration of the question: I had a subaru outback for awhile and absolutely loved it. One funny thing I noticed was that I had a rear windshield wiper, but never ever had to use it for more than one swipe. If my car had been out in the rain or snow, I would swipe it once then drive around and no rain or snow would accumulate at all so I would never need to leave the knob switched \"on.\" Then I began to notice that ONLY SUVS and hatchbacks have this thing. What the fuck? Why? I've yet to see a car with a slanted rear windshield that has one and I have not been able to figure out why\nHere is my answer: ",

    "Why are old houses built better than new construction?\nAn elaboration of the question: I own a home built in the 30s and everything in it is solid. Every door is made of real wood and has some heft to it. I have beautiful real hardwood in every room. There are little character details everywhere like special trim and a built in bookcase with cool matching arches on the doorways. Note, I do not own this great mansion or anything. It is just a classic American Foursquare, a very typical middle-class house during the time it was built but it has all of these great qualities built in. One of my friends just bought a house from the 90s and everything feels...worse. Not that the house isn't nice, it probably cost a good deal more than mine and is much larger, but all the doors were very light and just looked cheap. No hard wood floors only laminate that looked like wood (but obviously not), tile, and cheap carpet throughout the house. There was also absolutely zero character or even design to the house, except some sky-lights in the kitchen which were admittedly kind of cool. Why are things that were built in the first half of the 20th century seemingly much better than what came after? Or is the newer stuff actually better and I have no idea what I am talking about? This could be true, but it doesn't seem that way to me.\nHere is my answer: ",

    "Why, if petrol is more volatile and burns hotter and faster, are diesel engines more efficient in engines of the same size?\nAn elaboration of the question: In Europe particularly, diesel cars are much more popular now than petrol. A new diesel 1.6 engine burns much less fuel than a 1.6 petrol, for example. How can this be when petrol is much more volatile? Surely if it explodes at the rate it does, petrol can generate more power? Petrol cars are faster, but so much less efficient comparably.\nHere is my answer: ",
    "When jumpstarting your car, why do you connect the black cable to the engine block instead of the black/negative terminal?\nAn elaboration of the question: My mother needed a jump start earlier today and insisted on connecting red to red and black to black. Looking at the instructions on the cables and, later, on the internet you're supposed to connect the black cable to an unpainted section of the engine block of person's car with the dead battery. My mother insisted on doing it her way because she's done it that way before and it worked. I wasn't going to win the argument so I went along with her. Fortunately, the were no electrocutions or explosions. this time. So why do the instructions on the jumper cables say to do it their way and what could happen if you continue doing it incorrectly?

    "Are diesel cars better or worse for the environment than petrol cars?\nAn elaboration of the question: As I understand it, diesel is worse for the local environment as they cause more air pollution. So if all the cars in your city use diesel, you will have lower air quality than if all the cars in your city used petrol. On the other hand, diesel cars have better mileage than petrol and so contribute less to climate change. Netting these two factors, are diesel cars greener than petrol ones?\nHere is my answer: ",

Being that they all use gasoline, why is it that exhaust from classic cars and boats have smells unique to any other gasoline-fueled vehicles?\nHere is my answer: ",

    "How does a trains wheels actually stay attached when the train is moving or changing track?\nAn elaboration of the question: I've been using trains a little more frequently lately and I've always been interested in the engineering side of machinery but when I look at the small bit of metal that holds the train to the track it amazes me how it stays attached. It amazes me even more when I hear it change tracks because in my head all the train is doing is sliding onto the new track and falling into place with the hopes that it doesn't de-rail. Obviously people that are way smarter than me know what they're doing with this stuff but I would love to know just how they got to this.\nHere is my answer: ",
    "Why do we place offshore Wind Turbines in places with strong water currents? Surely more power could be generated by the water turbines given that water is roughly 816 times more dense than air?\nAn elaboration of the question: Recently in Victoria, Australia, they announced plans to build a bunch of offshore wind turbines. This location has strong winds but also has strong water currents. I can appreciate that wind might move faster than the water currents, but the water carries with it much more mass and hence the kinetic energy of the water would be much greater. So, usually you'd try to tap into the source with the greatest energy. Right?? I feel like I must be missing something, like there's concern about the water turbines hitting dolphins or schools of fish.\nHere is my answer: ",

Is that a 45-degree angle or a 90-degree angle? * Why does a 5-10% grade seem so intense? They have warning signs for trucks on 5% grades, but that doesn't seem like much! * I really start to confuse myself when I try to calculate the grade of a hill I'm walking/biking/running on. Let's say I'm walking on a 3-4-5km-sided triangle, where my hill is the 5km hypotenuse and the rise is 3km. That means I'm walking at a 30-degree angle, right? What percent grade is that (is it as crazy-high as I think it is?)? Is the grade calculated based on the fact that *I walk* 5 km and go up 3km, or is it based on the imaginary base of the triangle so I'm going up 3km over the course of 4km along that line?

    "Why did the Titanic's watertight compartments not have a watertight top?\nAn elaboration of the question: Every now and then I nerd out on engineering disasters. This week I got into the Titanic's sinking. I see that one of the prominent reasons it sank so fast is the \"transverse bulkheads\", walls that helped form its watertight compartments, were not watertight at the top and the \"top\" was not very far above the waterline. It seems to me incredibly stupid to call a compartment \"watertight\" if you know one side of it isn't watertight. But I also know when things look this stupid to me, I'm missing some vital piece of information that is key to making sense of the situation. My only guess is if the compartments were watertight on all six sides of the imaginary cube, the risk that air being compressed by incoming water could compromise the seal would increase? Why didn't they think sealing the top of the compartments was a good idea, if that isn't it?\nHere is my answer: ",

Are there any advantages or disadvantages to having an engine with 8 pistons, to having an engine with 6 slightly larger pistons to give the same volume? Edit* Just to \"ELI5\" my question, the v6 means the engine has 6 pistons, and v8 means the engine has 8 pistons. The volume in that relation, unless I have been lied to my whole life, is the total combined volume of all the pistons when pulled all the way back. Correct me if I'm wrong but a 6 piston engine has 0.66 liters of volume in each piston (4l/6pistons), and an 8 piston engine has 0.5 liters of volume in each piston (4/8).\nHere is my answer: ",

( people not respecting STOP , or right priority , people stoping the car after green light for no reason , people not using signal and changin lanes very close , or just not looking in the mirror and driving slowly over me , or near the dorms is like everyone is trying to get killed , had people jump in front of the car from the front of a stationary van at 150m from a crosswalk) But the closest situation was because of me , i was looking in the mirror to change lanes and when i turned the head back i realized the vehicle in front was slowing to stop and barely had time to stop with a creak. Can you actually use handbrake to stop a moving vehicle? Or will not help if the normal breaks cannot stop ? (Edit : both at the same time just in case you belive you cannot stop with normal breaks) Does it come with a risk of losing control (on sunny weather).

    "Why is it that airplane flight sticks are configured to roll left/right when you move the stick left/right instead of yaw left/right?\nAn elaboration of the question: I'm not a pilot, but I've played flight sims (both \"real\" and arcade-like) since the 90's, and Kerbal Space Program for 4 years. This just occurred to me: Why is it that airplane flight sticks are configured to roll left/right when you move the stick left/right instead of yaw left/right? KSP uses the old gamer keyboard layout (WASD), and W/S are pitch up/down just like an airplane, but A/D are yaw left/right. Roll is set as Q/W. I've heard the flight stick described as \"moving the nose\" of the airplane. So it seems to me if you want to move the nose of the aircraft to the right, shouldn't you move the stick to the right? Instead, in a real airplane, you have to use the foot pedals which control the rudder, which is what actually makes the airplane yaw. Is it just some odd historical quirk that arose during the early days of airplanes and just kind of stuck? I know in those early days, all the controls were mechanical, with cables and pulleys and such connecting the controls to the rudder and ailerons. But these days, it's all fly-by-wire, so it shouldn't matter how the controls are set up, right?\nHere is my answer: ",

    "Why do modern airplanes not use reverse thrust on all engines?\nAn elaboration of the question: I remember vividly when I was flying at a young age (think 727, A300 etc.) that after touchdown all engines went to reverse thrust. It was awesome for me as a child to see the jet engine \"morph\" like that. I have learned that most of the \"braking\" comes from the wheels. So my questions ist, why did they use it more in the 80s/90s. Why less nowadays? If it is inefficient, why do modern planes use it at all?\nHere is my answer: ",

    "What are the benefits of salt grinders?\nAn elaboration of the question: I totally get the benefit of pepper grinder. Pepper locks some aromatic oils, and when left ground for long, the oils evaporate. Salt, on the other hand, has no oils in it, just solid minerals. So what is the different between \"freshly ground\" and not freshly ground? I crushed some salt and left it aside for 2 weeks, couldn\u2019t find any difference between it and \"freshly crushed\" salt.\nHere is my answer: ",

    "How does a Qubit collapse into its correct state?\nAn elaboration of the question: I'm doing a project on Quantum Computing and I've hit a bit of a wall when it comes to Qubits being in the \"right\" state as it were. As an example if a Quantum computer were asked to find the two prime factors of a number (like in decryption/encryption), how would the Quantum computer read the selection of Qubits to give the correct solution? The only way I can think of this happening is to have a selection of logic gates that somehow collapse the Qubit into the correct state when observed; however, I'm not too sure how this actually would work with Qubits. Any overview/condensed answers would be as much appreciated as those which go into a more atomic/chemical depth about how it would all physically function. Cheers!\nHere is my answer: ",

    "Why do so many passenger planes use the Deakin method (dragging the nose and then lifting off suddenly) instead of allowing the plane to naturally lift off and having a slower initial climb?\nAn elaboration of the question: Airport runways are more than long enough to account for the latter and it should be a lot less strain on the planes and is arguably a lot smoother. I understand that this allows the passenger plane to get to *Vy* faster, but is that the only reason? It seems more risky to passengers and if getting to *Vy* faster is the only reason, it seems like a dumb business decision that puts more stress on the plane and quite frankly, the passengers than what is needed.\nHere is my answer: ",

    "Why do/did automatic gearboxes use planetary gears?\nAn elaboration of the question: I know that today there are many different types of automatic gearboxes (good ol' classic automatic, all kinds of semi-automatic robotic thingys, cvt:s etc), but back in the day pretty much all automatic transmissions in cars used planetary gears instead of \"normal\" gears consisting of different cogs. My question is: *Why were planetary gears preferred for automatic instead of \"normal\" gears?* I know how planetary gears work and I know how normal gears work. I also know how torque converters work and I know that classic automatic transmissions used hydraulics in some way to determine which gear should be engaged. But why use planetary gears? Do they work better with the hydraulic system? I also know this has been asked here at least once before, about a year ago but I didn't find any satisfying answers there.\nHere is my answer: ",

    "Why are trailer tractors so boxy and non-aerodynamic?\nAn elaboration of the question: So, first of all, there's a shape difference between tractors in Europe and the ones in the US. EU ones are pretty much a flat surface slamming against the wind at 100+km/h. US tractors have a front mounted engine, which gives them a seemingly more aerodynamic shape. However, when brought together together in the same plane, the engine and the windshield have roughly about the same surface area, with both surfaces being mostly flat. I don't know if the US trucks are more aerodynamic or not, so some input on this would be nice, as well. The overall question, however, remains: how come aerodynamics doesn't play a role in truck development? Considering the fuel costs, the large front surface area and the speed they cruise at, you'd think aerodynamics would be something truck manufacturers should be all over.\nHere is my answer: ",

    "Why European fire safety standards are so lax compared to the US and Japan?\nAn elaboration of the question: On my most recent trip to Europe I've noticed that the fire safety is appalling. Examples: Almost all business everywhere have inward opening front doors with no panic bars. My hotel in France requires a key to get out the door if it is locked. My Airbnb in Prague required an electronic release to open the front door of the building (what happens if it melts in a fire?) and multiple keys to get out of the door to the apartment and there was no secondary egress. The stairway at my grandmother's apartment in Denmark lights on a timer and no emergency lighting. The egress stair was under construction and had no functional lighting at all and no interim life safety plan was posted. Literally none of the outlets are grounded at all either (forget about GFCI). There has also been a chair on one of the landings for 20 years as one of the residents has a bad leg and gets tired.

    "Why do manufacturers have english and metric nuts and bolts in the same system? Isn't is cheaper to be consistent?\nAn elaboration of the question: I noticed a lot of times when I'm working on a project that I'll have bolts that are 10mm or 15mm, then other bolts that are 5/8 or 1/2 inch. Sometimes it makes sense, e.g. my Toyota and Acura cars seemed to always have Metric parts and my bicycles (Huffy, Roadmaster) always seemed to have english. Lately, though, it seems that it doesn't matter what brand something is, I can never predict whether the bolt will be english or metric. I was working on an Oldsmobile and it had a 1/2 inch bolt on the front of a bracket and 2x 15mm bolts on the back. Is there a reason for this? It seems arbitrarily difficult and time consuming to swap out sockets all the time.\nHere is my answer: ",

    "Gas pedal and torque in steep incline.\nAn elaboration of the question: I don't drive much. Less than ten times a year but it is always a long haul (at least 500 km). So I was driving in my small rental (manual) and found myself climbing a steep hill on icy and snowy highway. I pushed the pedal to the metal but both rpm and speed remained constant. I understand that during incline we need more torque and speed should remain the same but I couldn't figure how rpm remained constant. In normal case you shift to slower gear giving you more torque with same rpm but my car is manual so it can't be doing this. If I push the gas pedal my engine gets more air and fuel so it should run faster (more rpm) and there for my tires should rotate faster (more speed). Then I alter torque by shifting gears. But ELI5 me this: When in steep incline on gear 5 how does my speed, rpm and gear remain constant when I increase fuel to engine?\nHere is my answer: ",

    "What makes a river like the Mississippi change course?\nAn elaboration of the question: I understand that sediment from upriver settles and causes the river to change course, but I just can't wrap my head around how the mechanisms for that actually work. It seems like before the sediment could come even close to clogging up the current channel, the force of the river would clear that sediment away. We can assume that we're not even talking about the man-made levees that keep the river controlled now.

I also know this is a common problem in my home town in Australia, nearly every car my friends and family own all present this problem. But why? Can it not just tell us the actual speed? Apparently different countries of origin use different ways to regulate the speedometer and as such, results in a lot of different speed readings for different car manufacturers.
