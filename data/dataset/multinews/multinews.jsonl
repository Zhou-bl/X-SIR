We used Heritrix (3.1.1-SNAPSHOT) crawler software and respected robots.txt directives. The scope of the crawl was not limited except for a few manually excluded sites. \n \n However this was a somewhat experimental crawl for us, as we were using newly minted software to feed URLs to the crawlers, and we know there were some operational issues with it. For example, in many cases we may not have crawled all of the embedded and linked objects in a page since the URLs for these resources were added into queues that quickly grew bigger than the intended size of the crawl (and therefore we never got to them). We also included repeated crawls of some Argentinian government sites, so looking at results by country will be somewhat skewed. \n \n We have made many changes to how we do these wide crawls since this particular example, but we wanted to make the data available “warts and all” for people to experiment with. We have also done some further analysis of the content. \n \n If you would like access to this set of crawl data, please contact us at info at archive dot org and let us know who you are and what you’re hoping to do with it.

The transfer to the US was a \"rescue mission,\" Dallas Zoo President Gregg Hudson says, because the elephants were slated to be killed to make room for rhinos at the Big Game Parks reserve in Swaziland, which is suffering a \"state-of-emergency drought.\" Activists, however, aren't happy. Connecticut-based Friends of Animals, which had filed for a preliminary injunction, was planning to make legal arguments \"to prevent a lifetime of captivity\" for the elephants during a Thursday hearing. Scoffs Hudson, \"There are those who would rather see elephants die than live in accredited zoos. We strongly disagree.\" In a statement, Friends of Animals accuses the \"devious\" zoos of \"secretly\" removing the elephants ahead of the hearing, writing, \"the underhandedness of this move cannot be overstated.\" The group contends that confining elephants in zoos can cause depression and other psychological problems. In a statement of its own, the Dallas Zoo calls claims that the elephants were taken from Swaziland under cover of darkness \"outlandish,\" adding that the transfer had been planned for months and \"there was no subterfuge.\" The US Fish and Wildlife Service approved the transfer in January. Also, the zoo notes, the preliminary injunction did not prohibit the relocation from going forward. The elephants, which were sedated and put into crates for the flight, range in age from 6 years old to 25. In exchange for the animals, the zoos will donate money toward the game reserve's rhino conservation program."}

Instead, she left after her first year to pursue a modeling career in Milan. \n \n As recently as a week ago, Ms. Trump’s website stated that she had obtained a degree before going on to become a philanthropist and skin care entrepreneur. \n \n On Wednesday, The Huffington Post noticed that the site had been entirely scrubbed of its content. People clicking on its address are now redirected to the Trump Organization’s website. \n \n In a Twitter post, Ms. Trump said the website had been removed “because it does not accurately reflect my current business and professional interests.” \n \n Last week, Ms. Trump’s speech at the Republican National Convention contained a few lines from Michelle Obama’s speech at the Democratic convention in 2008. The Trump campaign initially denied that she had plagiarized the lines. Eventually a Trump employee who had helped write the speech, Meredith McIver, acknowledged using Ms. Obama’s lines and apologized, saying it was unintentional.\nSummary:\n", "response": "– Negative headlines about a cribbed speech have died down, but now Melania Trump is facing a spate of new ones about the accuracy of a bio on her newly shuttered website.

The public acknowledgement comes after the Huffington Post reported that the site had disappeared amid questions over a college degree. On the site, she claimed to have earned \"a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia\" before embarking on a modeling career. But the New York Times notes that reporters have been pointing out for months now that she actually left the school after her first year. An unauthorized biography echoes the one-year-of-school story, reports CNN. The Trump campaign hasn't addressed the apparent discrepancy."}

And now … Jennifer and Amy? \n \n On Wednesday, Jennifer Lawrence met with a reporter here to discuss her final turn as Katniss Everdeen in “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2,” arriving in theaters on Nov. 20. But the conversation inevitably turned to more casual subjects, and Ms. Lawrence casually broke some news: She is writing a comedic screenplay with Amy Schumer (“Trainwreck”) and the women plan to co-star in it. \n \n “We play sisters,” Ms. Lawrence said. “We’re almost done writing. It just flowed out of us. We’ve got about 100 pages right now.” \n \n She continued, “Amy and I were creatively made for each other. We have different flavors.

I guess I should just say it: I’m in love with you,’” she recalled. “We started emailing, and then emailing turned to texting.” \n \n In early August, Ms. Schumer invited her new friend to go jet skiing and the resulting photos lit up the Internet. “We really hit it off, to say the least,” Ms. Lawrence said. \n \n She picked up her phone. “Let me just text Amy and tell her that I told you,” she said, beginning to type. Ms. Schumer responded immediately. Ms. Lawrence glanced at the message, and threw her head back in laughter. \n \n “I wrote, ‘I just spilled the beans to The New York Times.

Lawrence tells the Times she first met Schumer after emailing her to tell her she loved Trainwreck, this summer's successful comedy written by and starring Schumer. \"We started emailing, and then emailing turned to texting.\" Then texting apparently turned to jet-skiing. Vanity Fair reports that Lawrence crashed Schumer's annual vacation with her friends from high school earlier this month, and the two were photographed riding a jet-ski and making a human pyramid. When Schumer recounted the story on The Daily Show, Jon Stewart suggested she star in a comedy with Lawrence. Thanks, Jon!"}

Local residents believe that the killer must know the area to be able to identify people with rabbit hutches that are not visible from the road. \n \n Police in the Côtes-d’Armor region denounced a “series of acts of cruelty against domestic rabbits” in and around the town of Minihy-Tréguier. “The cages are opened then the animals are killed…\nSummary:\n", "response": "– A French town is being terrorized by a serial killer—but humans aren't the target. The Telegraph reports that someone in the village of Minihy-Treguier has so far slaughtered more than 100 rabbits, slipping into residents' yards, yanking rabbits out of their hutches, and either stomping them to death by foot or murdering them with a sharp tool of some kind. \"The cages are opened, then the animals are killed in cold blood and left at the scene,\" a police statement notes, per the Sunday Times. The town's mayor says there've been 15 attacks in all, starting in March, with some homes getting hit more than once. \"He returned to one home four times, killing 20 rabbits there in all,\" the mayor notes. One woman who lost six adult rabbits—as well as some of their babies, which died after the mothers were killed—tells local media she once surprised a man she though was the rabbit murderer, wearing a black hat and a long raincoat, one morning, \"but he had the time to make his escape.\" Oddly left alone in these murderous rampages: chickens and geese that often cohabitate with the bunnies. (Authorities don't think foxes or other animals are killing the rabbits, as was the case with a slew of mysterious cat deaths in the UK.)"}

Each of the four members were charged with two misdemeanors and sentenced to 15 days in jail. The members are also prohibited from attending “sports events” for three years. \n \n Four members of the Russian protest group Pussy Riot invaded the field during the second half of the World Cup final in an effort to “stop illegal arrests” at rallies and “let all political prisoners free” in Russia. \n \n Fifty-one minutes into the championship match between France and Croatia in Moscow, the four protesters disrupted the game wearing old-fashioned Russian police uniforms, the Associated Press reported, causing a minute-long delay in the action. One female protestor managed to high-five France forward Kylian Mbappe, while another was tackled by a Croatian player. \n \n Pussy Riot soon claimed responsibility for the disruption on social media, calling the performance art protest “Policeman enters the Game.” \n \n “Just a few minutes ago four Pussy Riot members performed in the FIFA World Cup final match — ‘Policeman enters the Game,'” the collective wrote. “Today is 11 years since the death of the great Russian poet, Dmitriy Prigov.

All in all, the authors hope to define peace as “the harmony achieved by the absence of violence or the fear of violence.” \n \n \n \n Once again, Iceland is the most peaceful country on earth, followed by Denmark and Austria. Meanwhile, conflict-ridden countries like Syria, South Sudan and Iraq and Afghanistan are at the bottom of the list. Syria landed at the bottom due, in part, to its civil war, which “broadened its international scope as a result of the Russian intervention that began in September 2015 on the side of the Syrian government,” the authors note. \n \n The United States ranks 100th (out of 163 total areas) in terms of peacefulness. This low score is thanks, in part, to these factors: “U.S. involvement in the armed conflict against ISIL escalated” and “relations between the U.S. and Russia have also deteriorated.” \n \n This study is far from the final word on peacefulness. The authors admit that “peace is notoriously difficult to define.” Plus, many of the things they use to measure peace are qualitative, and thus prone to human judgement, which can be skewed. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

But stressed mice with the gene developed depression-like symptoms which were then eased by using anti-depression drugs, they found. \n \n Depression, like many other mood disorders, is believe to have multiple causes, including genetic, for its symptoms vary widely among individuals. \n \n As many as 40 percent of depressed patients do not respond to drugs, which are mainly based on boosting uptake of a brain chemical called serotinin. \n \n Almost one in six Americans are afflicted by depression in any given year, and the disorder costs the US economy 100 billion dollars annually, according to figures quoted in the study. \n \n The finding \"identifies MKP-1 as a potential target for a novel class of therapeutic agents, particularly for treatment-resistant depression,\" Yale said in a press release. \n \n Copyright © 2010 AFP.

The films within the film are hypothetical visions occurring in the mind's eye of the listener. But because the mind's eye in question belonged to Disney, the screen was filled with Disney imagery unmoored from a story -- an experimental film in kid-flick drag. It was all about how the music interacted with the images -- so precisely that it was as if the two art forms, instrumental performance and animation, were dancing together. The Sorcerer's Apprentice. The mushrooms. The centaurs. The dancing hippos. The volcanos. The dinosaurs. The demon. Parts of it are silly or cloying. Other parts are terrifying. And almost all of it is staggeringly beautiful. \"Fantasia\" was the first (and so far only) Walt Disney film to prompt viewers to ask, \"What am I looking at?\" and \"What does it mean?\" It's the Disney movie as powerful hallucinogen.

The video, which has amassed more than 4.1 million views so far, was first posted on Facebook Saturday by Steven Stubenrauch, who said he got it from a buddy from Down Under. But while the shot to the 'roo's face is indeed cringeworthy, Mashable explains there's a \"saga behind it,\" and it's \"very intense.\" The man in the video, IDed by News.com.au as Greig Tonkins—nicknamed \"Goo,\" meaning this fight could be deemed \"Goo vs. 'Roo,\" as NineNews.com.au astutely notes—was part of a hunting trip in June for a friend named Kailem, who was in bad shape from cancer and wanted desperately to go on a boar-hunting trip with friends. And so Mathew Amor invited Kailem and some other friends, including Tonkins (who it turns out is a zookeeper), to his New South Wales property for the hunt, and while they were gallivanting about, the featured kangaroo reached out, grabbed Tonkins' dog Max, and put the pup in a headlock. And so Tonkins jumped into action, throwing the punch now seen 'round the world. Everyone turned out to be fine: Amor says Max was startled but OK, the kangaroo was simply \"stunned,\" and Tonkins came away unscathed because he didn't throw that hard of a punch. \"It was funny because the guy who did it is the most placid bloke,\" Amor says. \"We laughed at him for chucking such a s--- punch.\" Sadly, Kailem died last week, but Amor says he'd \"be looking down from up there [heaven] and laughing because it was the highlight of the trip.\" (A cyclist says a kangaroo ruined her breast implants.)"}

APPAC compared outcomes for open appendectomy with antibiotic therapy for acute uncomplicated appendicitis, finding that antibiotics were a reasonable alternative to appendectomy. The study failed to meet its prespecified noninferiority margin to demonstrate that antibiotic treatment resulted in clinical outcomes that were “no worse than” outcomes with surgery, the operations were open and not laparoscopic, expensive broad-spectrum antibiotics were used, and the hospital lengths of stay were too long in each group (median, 3 days in the antibiotic group and in the surgery group). Despite the study limitations, of the 257 patients in the antibiotic group, 186 (73%) initially treated with antibiotics did not require surgery at the 1-year end point. However, concerns were raised that these patients would eventually require surgery, and various experts recommended that the APPAC results for clinical decision making not be used until the long-term outcomes were known for the patients who received antibiotic treatment.

Injured patrons were most likely to be female, with roller coasters and water slides being the most common culprits. Older attractions also caused more problems than newer rides."}

TBS A big push for Apple this year is recycling, as it uses partners and fancy new robots to make sure that valuable parts from the millions of iPhones sold per year don't end up in landfills. \n \n The company released its annual environmental report on Thursday, and it included some information about just how much it can recover from old computers — over 61 million pounds of steel, aluminum, glass, and other materials. \n \n As part of that, Apple recovered 2,204 pounds of gold— well over a ton. \n \n At the current spot price of $1,229.80 per troy ounce of gold, Apple recovered just under $40 million in gold from old phones and computers. \n \n But where did this $39,502,000 of gold come from? According to Fairphone, an activist group focused on electronics supply chains, the average smartphone uses 30 milligrams of gold, mostly in circuit boards and other internal components. And Apple pays to recycle millions of iPhones and other computers that have tiny bits of gold in them. \n \n It's also possible that Apple might have recycled a few golden Apple Watches, which have been estimated to have over 50 grams of 18-karat gold in it.

Out of nearly 90 million pounds of electronic equipment it recovered last year, 61 million pounds were recycled, Apple reports. Specifically, it reclaimed 23 million pounds of steel; 13 million pounds of plastic; 12 million pounds of glass; 4.5 million pounds of aluminum; 3 million pounds of copper; 6,600 pounds of silver; and 2,200 pounds of gold. That amounts to $1.7 million worth of silver, $6.5 million of copper—and a whopping $43 million in gold, reports Quartz. Activist group Fairphone, which watches electronics supply chains, notes that a typical smartphone contains 30 milligrams of gold, mainly in circuit boards and other internal components, reports Business Insider. It's not a lot, but spread across millions of phones and other electronics, it adds up. CNNMoney reports that while it's pricey, gold is a popular choice in consumer electronics for being corrosion resistant yet excellent at conducting electricity. (Silver is a superior conductor but corrodes easily.) In March, Apple unveiled an experimental bot called Liam, which can disassemble an iPhone in 11 seconds and sort its parts for recycling. Prototypes are already at work, and the line is designed to take apart 1.2 million phones a year. \"It's an experiment in recycling technology, and we hope this kind of thinking will inspire others,\" Apple notes.

The penny might be more trouble than it's worth. The cost to produce the one-cent coin increased to 1.5 cents during 2016, the Wall Street Journal reported. In 2015, the penny cost 1.43 cents to make, while in 2014, its production value was 1.66 cents. \n \n The president and Congress is constantly cutting funds to important programs to save money. Here’s a easy way to cut the budget plus get rid of a coin no one really likes or needs. Our bases overseas do not use pennies. The lowest denomination is the nickel. The only pennies you see overseas are those brought over by new recruits. ||||| Pennies aren’t cheap. \n \n The one-cent US coin, mostly made of zinc with a little bit of copper, is the most abundant coin in the country. Last year, the US Mint produced more than 8.4 billion pennies for circulation. Between production costs and shipping, they cost $0.0182 each, which totaled to $69 million (pdf, p. 9) in losses compared to their total value—the biggest in nine years. This is likely due to the rising cost of zinc for use in heavy industry, construction, machine and ship building, and steel production. \n \n Nickels have cost more to make than their monetary value for over a decade. The five-cent coins—75% copper and 25% nickel—cost about seven cents each to produce last year. Prices for copper have surgedIt’s a key ingredient in any kind of circuit or wiring, and the rise of electric cars in particular has put stress on the market. Nickel has also gotten more expensive for its use in stainless steels. \n \n Fortunately, dimes and quarters are cheaper to make, costing less than their monetary value. So the Mint makes up the losses incurred on pennies and nickels with its 10- and 25-cent coins, and last year reported making $391.5 million in seigniorage.\nSummary:\n", "response": "– It costs more than a penny to make a penny. The US Mint produced more than 8.4 billion of the one-cent coins last year, at a cost of $0.0182 each with production costs and shipping taken into account. That means $69 million was lost when compared to the pennies' total value, Quartz reports, the biggest loss in nine years. That's probably because zinc (pennies are made mostly of zinc, with a small amount of copper) has been rising in price. Nickels, which are worth five cents, cost seven cents each to make, but dimes and quarters cost less than their value to produce, which ends up making up for the losses associated with pennies and nickels. Even so, petitions abound on the internet to abolish the penny and nickel."}

Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| A recent study found that, on average, Europeans work fewer hours than Americans do. \n \n According to the paper, Americans work nearly 25% more hours than Europeans. In other words, that’s an additional 258 hours per year or an hour more each weekday. The working paper, which has not yet been published, was written by three economists—Alexander Bick of Arizona State University, Bettina Bruggeman of McMaster University in Ontario, and Nicola Fuchs-Schundeln of Goethe University Frankfurt. \n \n The authors looked at 18 European countries and the U.S. Of the 19 total countries they examined, the U.S. came out on top averaging 26.1 hours per person per week; Italy worked the fewest hours with an average of 18.4 hours. \n \n The study looked at hours per person. It doesn’t only include people currently in the workforce, but those either retired or taking time off for some other reason, like unemployment or vacation. Ultimately, it doesn’t measure productivity, but rather total time spent at work. \n \n The disparity in hours worked between the U.S. and Europe could be explained in various ways or, more likely, is an amalgamation of numerous different reasons. Taxes, for one, are much higher in Europe than in the U.S. According to Bloomberg, that gives European workers less incentive to work longer hours. It may also have something to do with labor unions, which generally have more power in Europe than they do in the U.S. \n \n Additionally, Europeans tend to get generous pensions, rather than investment plans like the 401(k) many American workers receive. As a result, there are more American workers over 65-years-old now than there have been at any point in the past 50 years.\nSummary:\n", "response": "– Feel like you're working too much? Consider moving to Europe: Europeans work 19% fewer hours than US workers, or about one hour less per weekday, a new paper finds. Researchers looked at three labor-force surveys from the US and Europe to find out how many hours a person works, on average, in various countries. They found that Americans work an average of 1,353 hours per year, the highest number of the 19 countries studied, Fortune reports. Compare that to Italy, where each person only works an average of 960 hours per year, the lowest number of hours of any country studied. Americans are also retiring later, taking less vacation time, and, as Quartz reports, are more likely to work odd hours, such as the middle of the night or weekends. As recently as the early 1970s, US and Western European workers actually clocked about the same number of hours, Bloomberg reports. It's not clear what's changed or how to account for the discrepancy, but some economists point to the fact that there's more incentive to work harder for a promotion in the US, because people earn a wider range of incomes there than in Europe, so it's more likely they'll get a significant raise. There's also the fact that taxes are significantly higher in Europe, meaning that there's less of an incentive to work more hours and earn more money that will be taxed. Finally, there's the fact that labor unions and worker protections are stronger in Europe, and pensions are more generous there."}

They cost around $2.50 and are the stuff of nightmares. \n \n They're especially popular among middle-aged Chinese women seeking to protect their skin from sun damage. \n \n Beauty standards vary around the world, as we know. While some folks head to the beach for a tan, these ladies consider fair skin a sign of wealth and attractiveness. And the facekini proves they'd rather look ridiculous than bronze. \n \n The #facekini is a thing in China. Influenced by #SpringBreakers? Do I even want to know? http://t.co/pfQaEcT47Z pic.twitter.com/clAAE05aXR — Brad Wilke (@jbwilke) October 15, 2013 \n \n Facekinis have been mocked on social media, and it's easy to see why. But at least one fashion editor reckons they could be the next big thing. \n \n Former Vogue Paris editor Carine Roitfeld has just published a photo shoot of models wearing facekinis and some very expensive swimsuits in her magazine, CR Fashion Book. \n \n “While our summer beauty routines are devoted to bronzing, self-tanning, and tan-extending, in Asia, beauty-seekers are more likely to center theirs around lightening and brightening,” the editorial reads. “A tan does not signify a chic trip to Capri, but it could mean hours of hard labor spent out in the harsh sun.\" \n \n #Chinese Dama make great contribution to fashion again!

Come and find your #style! pic.twitter.com/WoFZJn2jzs — EastSunnet (@Eastsunnet_) August 15, 2014 \n \n Okay, so maybe facekinis look just as weird in a high-end fashion magazine as they do on a beach. \n \n But there's at least one reason to hope that facekinis go mainstream: skin cancer.\nSummary:\n", "response": "– Looking for hot new beachwear before the summer fades away? Then you might—or, let's face it, might not—try a facekini, one of those colorful masks that started drawing attention on Chinese beaches in 2012, Global Post reports. What first looks like a pastel terrorist hood has actually been popular among middle-aged Chinese women for its UV protection. Now, a former Vogue editor has published a photo spread of women wearing facekinis in the magazine CR Fashion Book. \"A tan does not signify a chic trip to Capri, but it could mean hours of hard labor spent out in the harsh sun,\" says the magazine. Indeed, that's the point: The Chinese have long revered white skin as a sign that someone is too wealthy to have to work outdoors, the BBC reports. \"One touch of white disguises 100 kinds of ugliness,\" goes an old Chinese saying. But now some big-city Chinese are picking up Western notions of beauty and even going to tanning salons. Meanwhile, Western interest in facekinis inspired 12 million comments over two days on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter: \"Chinese old women are at the center of the global fashion world,\" said one; \"It looks like bank robbers are raiding the beach,\" said another.

Greeters at Walmart may assist customers with cart selection, offer coupons, or simply welcome people to the store. Walmart greeters may direct customers to specific areas of the store or note a return a customer brings back. Greeters with Walmart may need to perform other assigned duties, according to shift and location. Walmart greeters may clean store entryways, departments, or even restrooms if assigned such a task from a managing supervisor. Greeters at Walmart may also need to identify customers for security purposes. \n \n Salary and Compensation \n \n Employment benefits and competitive salary options await qualified Walmart greeters. Greeters with Walmart may receive a variety of job benefits. Eligible Walmart greeters may take advantage of several financial work benefits, such as paid vacation days or 401(k) retirement program, and health-related work benefits, such as vision, dental, medical, and life insurance plans. Starting pay for a Walmart greeter often falls near minimum wage. Walmart greeters may earn more with experience and more time served with the department store chain. \n \n Apply Online: Walmart Application Online\nSummary:\n", "response": "– Walmart's shelves may not be as organized as they usually are, but a friendly \"hello\" will never be in short supply now that the retailer has started its latest experiment: moving its greeters back to the front entrances to boost \"door presence,\" the Wall Street Journal reports. In efforts to deter theft and improve customer service, management is cutting down on the greeters' multitasking duties in 300 of its 4,500 US locations, returning greeters to the perch from which many had been removed to help out in other areas of the store, the paper notes. Some entrances will also be staffed by members of the APCS (asset protection customer specialist) team, yellow-shirted employees who in addition to greeting customers will check receipts of departing patrons and scan in merch being returned. Three years ago, Walmart started justifying many greeters' paychecks by shuffling them between their welcoming posts and other areas where help was needed, the Journal reports; a company job posting indicates \"Walmart greeters may clean store entryways, departments, or even restrooms if assigned such a task.\" But some stores reported increased merchandise losses—dubbed \"shrink\" in the industry—as \"people started walking out the door with cartloads of stuff,\" a stock employee tells the Journal. Such losses cost Walmart 0.13 of a percentage point of its US gross profit margin in the three months ending April, per CEO Doug McMillon's May conference call—which may not seem like a lot, but adds up when you consider the whopping $288 billion in US sales the retailer enjoyed last fiscal year.

I mean, good. Really good. This is how animated GIFs get made, folks! [via Mother Jones] ||||| WASHINGTON -- Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry raised some eyebrows Friday night with a speech performance in Manchester, N.H., that was unusually expressive. \n \n A Huffington Post reporter was in the audience for the speech but did not have a chance to review video footage of the Texas governor's remarks until Saturday afternoon when a montage of moments in the speech surfaced on YouTube. \n \n The video below is not a full version of his remarks. It is a carefully edited montage designed to highlight the giddiest and strangest moments of a roughly 25-minute speech. The owner of the YouTube account, CharlieJohnson1986, did not respond to a message sent to the account. \n \n But while the video is designed to make Perry look bad, it does capture elements of his speech that were widely remarked upon in the crowd by those who saw the speech. \n \n \"It was different,\" Manchester Mayor Ted Gatsas told HuffPost after the speech. \n \n A Perry spokesman did not respond to an e-mail Friday night inquiring about Perry's manner, and initially declined to comment on Saturday. \n \n Update at 9:25 p.m.: \n \n \"The Governor is passionate about the issues he talks about,\" Perry spokesman Mark Miner said in an email to HuffPost on Saturday night. \n \n This article has been changed to remove a reference unrelated to the event.

The first paper summarises data for the prevalence and consequences of problem use of amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, and opioids. In high-income countries, illicit drug use contributes less to the burden of disease than tobacco, but a substantial proportion of that burden is due to alcohol. Intelligent policy responses to drug problems need better prevalence data for different types of illicit drug use and the harms that their use causes globally. This need is especially urgent in high-income countries with substantial rates of illicit drug use and in low-income and middle-income countries close to illicit drug production areas. The second paper reviews existing drug policies and highlights the need for greater reliance on scientific evidence-based policy making. The final paper examines the value of international drug conventions in protecting public health.\nSummary:\n", "response": "– It appears that our friends from Down Under are in fact up higher than North Americans—a new study shows that Australians and New Zealanders are the world's top pot smokers, reports the Los Angeles Times.

The Daily Express kicks things off, citing a source who claims the couple will fly 200 to 300 people (including George Clooney, Tom Cruise, and more big names) to their $55 million estate in the south of France for a summer wedding. Guests will enjoy wines from the vineyard at their 35-room Château Miraval as Brad and Angie tie the knot at a private chapel on the grounds; they've spent millions refurbishing the estate and have been planning the wedding for half a year already, the source adds. Yet more sources blab to the Sun, claiming that Jennifer Aniston herself may be one of the boldface names attending the nuptials. Brad's ex \"couldn't be happier\" for her former hubby and his new flame, since \"if it weren't for Angelina, Jennifer would not have connected with\" new boyfriend Justin Theroux, says one. Last but not least, People has a close-up shot of Angelina's humongous ring. \"Brad had the vision\" for the custom sparkler, the jeweler tells the magazine.

In the letter dated Dec. 13, 2012, House Oversight Committee chair Darrell Issa explicitly asks whether the then-secretary of state \"or any senior agency official ever used a personal email account to conduct official business\" and requests that the accounts be identified. He also asks about \"alias\" accounts and text messages, CNN reports. Clinton never replied and left the State Department weeks later on Feb. 1, 2013. On March 27 of that year, the department described its policies for personal email use for Issa, as he had also requested. \"Employees may use personal email on personal time for matters not directly related to official business, and any employee using personal email 'should make it clear that his or her personal email is not being used for official business,'\" the State Department's assistant secretary for legislative affairs wrote. A rep refused to answer questions yesterday about why it avoided mentioning Clinton's email use. However, a Clinton aide says \"her usage was widely known to the over 100 department and US government colleagues she emailed, as her address was visible on every email she sent.\" Issa's initial letter was part of an investigation spawned when administration and EPA officials were found to be using private accounts for government business."}

The tax rate varies depending on the relationship of the heir to the decedent. \n \n The rates for Pennsylvania inheritance tax are as follows: \n \n 0 percent on transfers to a surviving spouse or to a parent from a child aged 21 or younger; \n \n 4.5 percent on transfers to direct descendants and lineal heirs; \n \n 12 percent on transfers to siblings; and \n \n 15 percent on transfers to other heirs, except charitable organizations, exempt institutions and government entities exempt from tax. \n \n Property owned jointly between spouses is exempt from inheritance tax. \n \n Effective for estates of decedents dying after June 30, 2012, certain farm land and other agricultural property are exempt from Pennsylvania inheritance tax, provided the property is transferred to eligible recipients. For more information about the exemptions and related requirements, please review Inheritance Tax Informational Notice 2012-01. \n \n Inheritance tax payments are due upon the death of the decedent and become delinquent nine months after the individual's death. If inheritance tax is paid within three months of the decedent's death, a 5 percent discount is allowed. \n \n For further information and answers to commonly asked questions, please review the brochure, Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax and Safe Deposit Boxes. \n \n For detailed and historic Pennsylvania inheritance tax information, please review the Tax Compendium.\nSummary:\n", "response": "– Roland Bosee Jr., 68, and Nino Esposito, 78, have been inseparable since they first met in 1970. \"You meet someone and it just clicks,\" Esposito told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last month. So with the SCOTUS decision over the summer to legalize gay marriage, the men looked forward to finally tying the knot. But one issue is holding them back: Esposito is technically Bosee's father, because he adopted him in 2012. \"We thought never in our lifetime—or in 20 lifetimes—...same-sex marriage [would] happen,\" Bosee said, adding to CNN that the adoption \"gave us the most legitimate thing available to us\" at the time. Even though they petitioned to have the adoption annulled, Allegheny County Judge Lawrence O'Toole —known for being progressive on LGBT issues—rejected that plea, noting that adoptions are typically only dissolved when fraud is involved and that nixing theirs \"would place in jeopardy and imperil adoption decrees generally.\" Adoptions of this sort are often sought to cement legal status for financial and other reasons, as well as to strengthen emotional ties. The men said it was both: Esposito told the Post-Gazette \"we felt we lacked a family of our own,\" but they also discovered that any money they inherited from each other would be subject to a much greater inheritance tax if they weren't considered relatives. One person on the couple's side: Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, who tells the Post-Gazette, \"I wasn't aware that LGBT couples were turning to this method. I can't even imagine having to get an adoption petition approved … to visit a loved one in the hospital.\" Casey has written a letter of support to AG Loretta Lynch, asking her office to \"consider issuing guidance\" in cases like this; her office is reviewing it, a rep tells CNN.

The new lingo, part II: Can you translate yet? The Journal has this jargony line (and an interpretation) from John Bunch, who's heading the shift to Holacracy. \"The idea is for each person to selfishly process their own tension. The reaction round is a sacred space.\" One specific experience: In the title-less world, Brironni Alex, 26, is no longer a customer-service manager, but now has \"more time for a workplace diversity committee and to perform on the Zappos dance team,\" per the Journal. How meetings have changed: At their end, employees can air their thoughts. A 24-year-old employee says she hears things like \"I can't wait to eat my leftover pizza for lunch.\" One specific circle: The Journal highlights one called \"Reinventing Yourself,\" which former managers are encouraged to join as part of their quest to figure out what they should do in the company now that they can't manage.

Nina Bernstein digs into the numbers by way of a 2012 food poisoning outbreak in upstate New York. She reviewed some of the more than 100 affected patients' bills, and quickly realized that some were charged as much as 200 times the manufacturer's price for a liter of saline—which has recently ranged from 44 cents to $1—plus another change for \"IV administration.\" A patient at White Plains Hospital got a bill that included $91 for a single unit of Hospira IV (hospital's cost: 86 cents), plus $127 for administering it.

Bernstein acknowledges we're pretty numb to the reality of inflated health-care costs, but sees something more in \"the tale of the humble IV bag\": \"secrecy that helps keep prices high.\" It's the product of purchasing organizations and distributors and other players who make deals that \"so obscure prices and profits that even participants cannot say what the simplest component of care actually costs, let alone what it should cost,\" she writes. \"And that leaves taxpayers and patients alike with an inflated bottom line and little or no way to challenge it.\" Read her full piece here."}

Unless the factory in question is Mercedes, which has recently replaced some machines with good old-fashioned people. \n \n Advertisement \n \n According to a Bloomberg report, Mercedes is on a trend of replacing fixed robots either with humans, or smaller, more flexible machines. The problems are being caused by the array of options on the new S-Class—four different hub caps and various trim options confused the poor robots, but are no match for our opposable thumbs and high-resolution eyeballs. \n \n The problems aren’t specifically caused by the machines moving too slowly—it’s the time taken to adjust and retool between slightly different production runs that is proving too difficult. \n \n One car maker slightly reducing its reliance on automated production is not the reversal of a global trend, and doom-and-gloom surrounding half of all current jobs being automated in decades isn’t over yet. But it’s also a timely reminder that as good as robots get, they’ve got a long way to go to beat the human machine. \n \n Advertisement \n \n [Bloomberg]\nSummary:\n", "response": "– Mercedes-Benz is pulling some robots off the production line at its biggest plant and replacing them with … humans. The reason? Mercedes offers so many options for its vehicles (such as four types of caps for the tire valves in the case of its S-Class sedan), it's \"too much ... for the machines,\" the company's head of production tells Bloomberg. “Robots can’t deal with the degree of individualization,\" Markus Schaefer continues. \"We’re saving money and safeguarding our future by employing more people.\" The Sindelfingen, Germany, factory produces 400,000 cars annually, and while humans can make changes to a production line in a weekend, reprogramming robots tacks on weeks, which doesn't jibe with Schaefer's push to halve the time it takes to make a car from the 61 hours it took in 2005. As far as specifics of this change go, Bloomberg points to the car maker's new E-Class, which is available beginning next month. The car's speed and navigation instructions are projected onto the windshield, and the task of aligning the display will shift in some cases from two permanent robots to a worker. Gizmodo points out that Mercedes' move does not herald the reversal of the trend that half of jobs will be automated in coming decades.

For now, the duck's origins remain a mystery: None of the city's zoos have this type of duck missing from the roster, and it's illegal in NYC to keep a duck as a pet. That means the duck perhaps escaped from, say, an owner in New Jersey and made its way to the city, or maybe the owner itself got sick of the duck and unceremoniously left it and ran. Either way, the duck has been a huge hit. \"It's just an incredible gift to New York,\" one birder tells CBS New York. Avian experts believe that based on its feeding habits—it likes bugs and vegetation skimmed from the water's surface—the duck should be able to survive just fine in the Big Apple, and park officials say they're just going to let it be unless it becomes injured. It already appears to have made friends with the park's mallards.

Mark Sanford (R) has been having a rough few weeks in his campaign to reclaim his old House seat. \n \n His ex-wife sued him for trespassing; national Republicans dropped their support for his campaign; and a poll found him trailing his Democratic challenger by a robust 9-point margin despite the race being in a reliably Republican district. \n \n So how did the Sanford campaign respond to that adversity? By having the candidate debate a cardboard cutout of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), a move seemingly ripped from the political playbook of Clint Eastwood, who famously delivered a rambling address at the Republican National Convention to an empty chair meant to represent President Obama. \n \n In a press event Wednesday, Sanford accused his opponent, Elizabeth Colbert Busch, of refusing to debate him publicly and thus running a \"stealth campaign.\" As a last resort, he said, he'd decided to instead debate \"Pelosi.\" \n \n \"Since Elizabeth won't debate, I'm allowed to debate Nancy,\" he said, before posing a question to the cardboard cutout about a National Labor Relations Board lawsuit that sought to block Boeing from building a new plant in South Carolina.

Here's how it went down, per Slate: Sanford's unbelievably wordy ad (which started, \"It's been a rough week\" and addressed Democratic attacks against him and that whole trespassing incident) invited people to call his campaign office or his cell—and his cell phone number was included—if they had any \"further questions.\" The House Majority PAC, which had already been supporting Elizabeth Colbert Busch in her race against Sanford, then reprinted that number in a fundraising email suggesting people \"take him up on his offer\" and call Sanford to \"ask why he spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars on luxury travel!\" Sanford then took screenshots of that fundraising email and his incoming call history and published it all. His campaign rep explains why he published the numbers: \"Look, if Pelosi and Co. are going to bat this hard for Colbert Busch, there ain't going to be anything 'independent' about her. We're putting it out there to illustrate just how interested Pelosi's allies are in getting Colbert Busch elected.\" Sanford is clearly not happy with Nancy Pelosi, and he showed it in another odd way Wednesday: by publicly debating a cardboard cutout of the House Minority Leader. He did so, he explained, because Colbert Busch won't debate him publicly, so he decided to debate Cardboard Pelosi instead. (Click to watch the video.)

Jeffrey Sandusky is on his way to a Pennsylvania state prison after pleading guilty to 14 counts of child sexual abuse, reports CNN. Under a plea deal, the 41-year-old will spend between three and eight years in prison. Prosecutors say Sandusky pressured a teenage girl under 16 to send him nude photos, the New York Times reports. After her father reported messages from Sandusky to police last year, investigators discovered that he had asked the girl's sister to perform oral sex on him in 2013, when she was 13. He pleaded guilty to charges including soliciting sex from a child younger than 16. Authorities say Sandusky, a former state prison guard who knew the girls through dating their mother, tried to persuade them that what he was doing was normal, saying \"it's not weird because he studied medicine,\" but asking them not to show his messages to anybody. Sandusky, like his mother, Dottie, loyally supported his father through his trial for the sexual abuse of 10 boys, the Times notes. Sandusky will now be classed as a Tier III sex offender, Pennsylvania's highest level, meaning he will have to register with state police for life and verify his information four times a year. (In June, three Penn State officials went to prison for failing to report allegations against the elder Sandusky.)"}

A series of underground tubes will transport beer from the De Halve Maan brewery at the center of Bruges, Belgium, to a bottling plant a couple miles away. \"It all started as a joke,\" brewer Xavier Vanneste tells the Wall Street Journal. But, four years after work began, the pipeline is just weeks away from completion. The project was \"born of environmental and quality of life concerns,\" Vanneste told AFP in an earlier story. Beer has been brewed at De Halve Maan's historic site for some five centuries. The bottling end of the operation was moved to an industrial area in 2010, creating traffic issues. The pipeline will eliminate some 500 truck trips through the city's narrow, cobblestone alleyways each year. Unfortunately, rumors notwithstanding, in-home taps aren't an option for locals. Once complete, the pipeline (a \"Willy Wonkian approach\" to the traffic problem, per the Independent) will transport 1,500 gallons of beer per hour at 12mph. The $4.5 million project was, in part, crowdfunded, with donors receiving lifetime supplies of beer (one 11 ounce bottle per day or one 25 ounce bottle per year, depending on the donation amount). A local restaurateur who contributed calculated that he would regain his investment, via beer, in 15 years. But, he tells the Journal, he would have preferred a direct tap to his establishment: \"It would have saved me a lot of keg-dragging.” The mayor of Bruges is now considering pipelines to transport all kinds of things, including chocolate. As for concerns that scofflaws may try to illegally tap the beer line, which is buried at depths of six to 100 feet, Vanneste says the polyethylene tubes are stronger than steel. But, the brewer promises, the flavor of its beers will be unaffected. (Bieber's beer bong encounter ended badly.)"}

I think John Hawkins is spot on in detecting the sarcasm here, but if you’re inclined to believe that Ayers is The One’s ghostwriter, you’re bound to detect a “deeper truth” in his tone. In fact, Ayers has been baiting people with this same corny line about splitting the royalties for ages. Back in October 2009, a conservative blogger spotted him in Reagan Airport and approached him. As soon as she mentioned that she was conservative, he offered, unprompted, that he had written the book, that Michelle Obama had put him up to it, and, yes, that he’d be happy to split the royalties with the blogger if she could prove it. When she countered that she thought he had at least edited it, he egged her on by insisting that no, he had written the darned thing. I think he enjoys mocking people who push this idea and enjoys it doubly when they can’t detect the mockery. In fact, I’d bet that this is his stock response anytime the book is mentioned in his presence — insisting that he wrote it to see if the listener laughs and then toying with them if they seem credulous. But as I say, your mileage may vary. \n \n Related Posts:\nSummary:\n", "response": "– Donald Trump isn’t content with questioning Obama’s citizenship—now he’s questioning his authorial accomplishments, too. In an interview with Laura Ingraham yesterday, Trump espoused the theory that Bill Ayers wrote Obama’s memoir, Dreams of My Father, Aol News reports. Obama is only the president “because he wrote a book that is supposed to be a great genius book,” Trump said. “But now it’s coming out that Bill Ayers wrote it.” Trump’s repeating a rumor that’s been circling in right-wing media. Ayers himself said that he had written the book at a speaking appearance last week, though as Allahpundit at the conservative blog Hot Air notes, it sounded a lot like he was being sarcastic. “Would you believe that I wrote it?” he said when asked about the book. “And if you can help me prove it, I’ll split the royalties.” At that the audience burst out laughing. Ayers has reportedly used the line, complete with the royalties punch line, in the past as well. Click for more."}

Gary and Thelma have the nicest lawn on the street, while your lawn is full of crabgrass. Pamela and Louise always find time to volunteer for the PTA, while you were so busy at work that you forgot to make cookies for the bake sale. Mike and David have well-behaved kids who don't terrorize the neighborhood, while you spent November 1 apologizing profusely for your child's Halloween shenanigans. Perceptions like these are an illusion, of course. Mike and David are secretly worried about raising boring children who never get into trouble. Pamela and Louise feel obligated to do the PTA as the only lesbian mothers in town. Gary and Thelma didn't travel to Europe because they spent too much money on their azaleas. Even couples who have done the near-impossible, like each winning an Academy Award, aren't guaranteed a happy life. A crowded mantel can complicate life. There's actually a conspiracy theory called \"the Oscar curse,\" which claims that receiving the award ultimately leads to romantic dissolution.

Jody and Jase Kinsey of Miles City, Mont., knew that multiples were a possibility—Jase's dad was a twin—but they weren't expecting to hear, from the tech at their first ultrasound, that there appeared to be three babies in there. They soon ended up under the care of the aforementioned specialist, Dr. Dana Damron, and Jody gave birth to sons Cade, Ian, and Milo on Dec. 5, the Billings Gazette reports. Jody, 30, and Jase, 29, were already parents to son Jax, 6. \"With them being identical, they all shared the same placenta so there could be possible complications,\" Jody explains; Damron kept a close watch to make sure all the babies were growing equally. Jody stopped working in September and was admitted to the clinic with early signs of labor in November, but ultimately the babies waited until 32 weeks—about the average gestational age for triplets, according to Damron. They were born via C-section between 3 pounds, 11 ounces and 4 pounds, 1 ounce, and all were \"in excellent condition,\" he adds. Cade has been released from the hospital, but doctors want Milo and Ian to get a little better at eating first.

Green's accomplice, Larry Martin Demery, testified that he and Green walked up to James Jordan's car with the intention of robbing him. Demery told the jury Green shot Jordan after he awoke from a nap and saw the two men outside his car. \n \n However, Green's attorneys, Scott Holmes and Ian Mance, contend Demery pulled the trigger and that their client wasn't at the scene at the time of the murder. They've brought forth new evidence in order to get Green a new trial, according to court documents obtained by Gordon and Washburn. \n \n Holmes and Mance have a sworn statement from the jury forewoman in Green's trial that says she investigated Jordan's murder on her own, which would've gone against the judge's orders. A former newspaper editor from Robeson County, North Carolina, also signed a sworn affidavit in which she described an admission by Demery that he committed the murder. \n \n The attorneys also cast doubt on the evidence provided by a state forensics expert regarding Jordan's blood being found in Green's car. \n \n The state of North Carolina has until the end of April to respond to Holmes and Mance's filing, and after that, Robeson County Superior Court Judge Robert Floyd will make a decision about a new trial. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Attorneys for the convicted gunman, Daniel Green, say the original trial was rife with problems that only now are coming to light, the Charlotte Observer reports. To recap, Green and Larry Demery were teenagers when they were tried for murdering 56-year-old James Jordan—whose son was an all-time great NBA player—during a 1993 carjacking in South Carolina. In the high-profile trial, Demery became a witness for the state and accused Green of pulling the trigger. With physical evidence apparently supporting Demery, both were found guilty and eligible for parole in 20 years, but Green got an added 10 years for conspiracy. Now Demery is up for parole consideration, and Green's attorneys are claiming that: The trial's jury forewoman broke the rules by conducting her own investigation of the murder. Other jurors may have violated orders by reading or seeing accounts of the case. A state forensics expert admits that her testimony about blood in the car (which supported Demery's version of events) was shaky, and she destroyed the only existing blood sample from James Jordan on a supervisor's orders. The editor of a local Native American newspaper said that during a jail interview, Demery admitted to pulling the trigger. The first person the killers called from James' car phone was a cocaine dealer who happened to be Robeson County Sheriff Hubert Stone's out-of-wedlock son, but the jury wasn't allowed to hear about the sheriff's connection. Details about that could undermine \"the entire Jordan investigation,\" the attorneys say. A judge is likely to rule on the attorneys' request sometime after the end of April, says Bleacher Report."}

He went to medical school, became a psychiatrist and now explains Ernest Hemingway to so many of his fans. \n \n For 20 years, Farah has used his training to study what a number of concussions that Hemingway suffered – at least nine, by Farah’s count – did to his brain. \n \n “You have this man who is a genius and, as he ages, the cumulative damage that his brain sustained led to a deterioration in the work - not only the life and interactions were affected but the work was affected,” says Farah. “And the two plane crashes in Africa really sealed the deal. Those were severe.” \n \n In one of them, Hemingway – probably already concussed from the crash – used his head to knock out the door he used to escape the plane that was filling with smoke. \n \n “Hemingway, himself, in multiple letters wrote about the effects of concussion,” says Farah. “And his exact words were, ‘I've been studying it and concussions are a funny thing.’” \n \n They weren’t funny by the end of his life. In fact, Farah believes they played a central role in why Hemingway killed himself in 1961, three weeks before his 62nd birthday, and tells the story in his new book \"Hemingway’s Brain.\" \n \n “There's so much mythology surrounding him that I wanted to set the record straight,” says Farah. \n \n See if you think he did in this edition of the Buckley Report. ||||| NYT bestselling author Wiley Cash’s new novel, ‘The Last Ballad,’ is his best\nSummary:\n", "response": "– In 1936, Ernest Hemingway told a friend he'd never kill himself, the Charlotte Observer reports. The great author was dead by his own hand 25 years later. According to Smithsonian, Hemingway scholars have long blamed the writer's decade-long decline and eventual suicide on some combination of alcoholism and bipolar disorder. But a psychiatrist in North Carolina says the actual culprit is something more associated with modern football players than authors: CTE. Andrew Farah has been studying Hemingway for 20 years, Fox 8 reports. By reading Hemingway's letters, memoirs by his friends and family, and the FBI file on him, Farah was able to trace what he believes is the source of Hemingway's downfall: at least nine concussions. Those concussions came from boxing, car crashes, exploding shells during two world wars, and more. \"His injuries and head traumas were frequent, random, and damaging,\" Farah writes in his newly published book, Hemingway's Brain. For example, following a plane crash that had likely already concussed him, Hemingway used his head to bash out a door and escape the plane. While we likely will never know for sure if Hemingway suffered from CTE, Farah says he showed symptoms in his final years, such as paranoia, anger, and violence. He also got worse following electroconvulsive therapy. \"It didn't take long to connect the dots,\" Farah tells Smithsonian. He says he hopes his conclusion will allow the focus to shift from the \"mythology\" of Hemingway's death to the greatness of his work. (How sports destroyed a young man's brain.)"}

While it seemed like it may have been a gag, MTV News can confirm that the moment was anything but planned. \n \n Plaza wasn't supposed to join the funnyman at all, and the whole back-and-forth was unscripted.

That seems to be the question surrounding Aubrey Plaza's stage-crashing moment last night at the MTV Movie Awards. The Parks & Rec star came onstage while Will Ferrell was accepting an award, and tried to grab the trophy without actually saying anything. An awkward tug of war followed, until Plaza finally returned to her seat as Ferrell said, \"Aubrey Plaza, everyone—just like we rehearsed it.\" But MTV claims the incident was not staged. Plaza had a cup in her hand (which she dropped en route back to her seat) and had the name of her upcoming film, The To Do List, written on her chest; many speculated on Twitter and elsewhere that she was drunk at the time. Producers later asked her to leave. Even so, Vulture seems skeptical. \"If it wasn't planned, why the heck was she sitting in the front row?\" writes Jesse David Fox. \"A bit too convenient for something that wasn't rehearsed or planned, no?\" And Jezebel notes that it was also \"the most exciting thing that happened\" during the show.

He is expected to elaborate on the thinking behind Klinsmann’s dismissal during a conference call with the news media on Tuesday afternoon.\nSummary:\n", "response": "– Jurgen Klinsmann is out as coach of the US men's soccer team, the AP reports, ending a contentious five-year love-hate relationship on the job. US Soccer Federation President Sunil Gulati announced Monday that Klinsmann has been \"relieved of his duties\" as coach and technical director for US Soccer. The move isn't exactly surprising, notes the New York Times, following a pair of embarrassing losses that damaged the Americans' efforts to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. The final straw came less than a week ago, as the Times puts it: \"Then came the 4-0 thrashing against the Ticos in which Klinsmann’s team looked alternately disorganized, dispirited and—perhaps most damningly—disinterested.\" \"While we remain confident that we have quality players to help us advance to Russia 2018, the form and growth of the team up to this point left us convinced that we need to go in a different direction,\" said Gulati in a statement. Klinsmann replaced Bob Bradley in July 2011 and led the team to the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup title and the second round of the 2014 World Cup, where the Americans lost to Belgium in extra time. But the US was knocked out in last year's Gold Cup semifinals, lost to Mexico in a playoff for a Confederations Cup berth and started 0-2 this month in the final round of World Cup qualifying."}

A Wang spokeswoman says he's a US permanent resident, which would make his contributions legal. \"Neither the Governor nor his former campaign has knowledge of this matter, but as reported, contributions to the campaign from Mr. Wang were completely lawful,\" says McAuliffe-campaign attorney Marc Elias.

At 74 liters of wine per person, double Italy's consumption, Religion News Service reports—and in terms of major countries, Italy is one of the top two wine consumers. That amount translates to about 105 bottles of wine per resident per year, the Independent notes. And no, this doesn't hinge around all that communion wine. As local media have pointed out, the number is probably so high because Vatican residents are, in general, older, male, and highly educated, and they eat communal meals. All of those factors tend to increase wine consumption. And with a population of just 800, those numbers are easily skewed by outliers. Oh yeah, and then there's the fact that just one store sells wine in the Vatican—and the wine is practically tax-free."}

It says the company has at least 200 creditors and owes its top 20 creditors $3.66 million. \n \n The water was tainted after a chemical used to clean coal leaked from a storage tank and then a containment area at a facility owned by Freedom Industries. The water ran into the Elk River, contaminating the state's largest water system. \n \n The bankruptcy document says the leaky storage tank appears to have been pierced through its base by some sort of object. It also says a current theory for the hole is that a local water line that broke near the Charleston plant could have made the ground beneath the storage tank freeze in the cold days before the spill. \n \n After the spill, residents in a nine-county area around the state capital of Charleston were told not to use the water for anything other than flushing toilets. Some businesses and schools were forced to close for several days. The water restrictions have since been lifted for most residents. \n \n The terminal that leaked had not been inspected by state officials since 2001, when it was owned by a different company operating under more stringent rules.

WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box. ||||| Amazon may be taking an even stronger hold on the delivery business 11:44 AM ET Fri, 9 Feb 2018 | 00:50 \n \n Amazon is gearing up to launch a delivery service for businesses, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. \n \n This would pit the e-commerce giant against the likes of FedEx and UPS. \n \n The service is called \"Shipping with Amazon\" and will see the tech giant picking up packages from businesses and delivering them to customers, the WSJ said, citing people familiar with the matter. \n \n Amazon's business delivery is expected to roll out in Los Angeles in the coming weeks with third-party merchants that sell goods via its website. More cities are to follow. \n \n The U.S. firm will eventually roll this out to other businesses with Amazon planning to undercut UPS and FedEx on price, according to the WSJ. \n \n Shares of FedEx and UPS were sharply lower in pre-market trade on Friday morning. \n \n UPS said it is still a partner of Amazon. \n \n \"UPS continues to support Amazon and many other customers and we don't make comments about their business strategies or decisions regarding their utilization of UPS services,\" a spokesperson for the company told CNBC in an emailed statement. \n \n Read the full Wall Street Journal article here.\nSummary:\n", "response": "– Amazon isn't just expanding grocery deliveries: The company will soon offer a shipping service for businesses, putting it in direct competition with UPS and FedEx, whose shares saw sharp declines in pre-market trading Friday, per CNBC. \"Shipping with Amazon\" will see Amazon pick up packages from third-party merchants who sell on Amazon's website before shipping them to buyers at lower rates than offered by UPS and FedEx—though Amazon may have to use those companies to reach areas beyond its delivery network, sources familiar with the plan tell the Wall Street Journal. The service is expected to debut within weeks in Los Angeles, where a pilot program has been in the works for more than a year. The service could be expanded to more cities, possibly this year. \"We're always innovating and experimenting on behalf of customers and the businesses that sell and grow on Amazon to create faster lower-cost delivery choices,\" a spokeswoman says, without offering specifics, though the Journal notes \"Shipping with Amazon\" could eventually be offered to other businesses, too. Sources say Amazon will be able to undercut UPS and FedEx because it already delivers some of its own orders in 37 cities. \"Any extra space it can fill in its trucks with additional deliveries is considered added revenue,\" the Journal reports, noting Amazon eventually hopes to offer two-day deliveries, even on weekends."}

This time, the exhibitionist seems to be Puerto Rican conservative Sen. Roberto Arango, who had several anatomically vivid pics show up on popular gay cruising app Grindr, reports Gawker. When asked about the photos by a Puerto Rican TV station, Arango responded with an Anthony Weiner-esque non-denial: \"You know I've been losing weight. As I shed that weight, I've been taking pictures. I don't remember taking this particular picture but I'm not gonna say I didn't take it. I'd tell you if I remembered taking the picture but I don't.\" Even more damning than the initial photo, which showed a shirtless man with his face covered (but wearing a necklace similar to one Arango commonly wears), was a second pic apparently found on the same Grindr account, showing a nude man bent over, from behind. Several prominent Puerto Rican politicians, including the governor, called on Arango to resign if the photos are of him. Arango, who was vice-chair of George Bush's re-election committee in Puerto Rico in 2004, is known for opposing gay rights legislation."}

Case in point: “LOL” is dying. A Facebook report claims that LOL is now one of the least popular ways to express laughter on the social network. Why? Probably because of mom. \n \n Advertisement \n \n The waning popularity of LOL correlates with aging demographics. In other words, only old people are using LOL these days, presumably because it was popular in the internet’s early days but is now falling out fashion as emoji becomes the universal language of youths. However, variations of “haha” and “hehe” are still the most popular expressions of laughter. \n \n Poor LOL. \n \n Advertisement \n \n The Facebook report fails to consider the ironic use of expressions like LOL or even haha, but the data doesn’t lie. Lots of people on Facebook have abandoned LOL, and those who do use LOL are older. Is this because old people like your mom think it’s still cool or can’t figure out how to find the emoji keyboard or maybe it’s because your mom thinks LOL stands for “lots of love?” \n \n There are plenty of ways to explain why LOL has fallen out of fashion—but one thing is for sure: LOLers are getting older as emoji takes over. Rest in peace LOL. Long live 😂. \n \n [Facebook via Gizmodo UK]\nSummary:\n", "response": "– A recent New Yorker essay about online laughter prompted Facebook to crunch data on how people actually express a chuckle in the ether. It's probably not a big surprise to find out that LOL is no longer the phrase of choice, but it might be surprising at just how far the old standby has fallen. In a week's worth of posts in May, just 1.9% of people who expressed laughter did so via LOL. Meanwhile, the undisputed the champion is \"haha\" (including variations such as \"hahaha\") at 51.4%, followed by the use of emoji at 33.7%, and \"hehe\" at 13.3%. Some other takeaways: 15% of people indicated laughter in at least one post or comment Residents of Chicago and New York prefer emoji, while those in San Francisco and Seattle like \"haha\" More men use \"haha\" and \"hehe,\" while more women use emoji So what's going on?

CDC is concerned about C. auris for three main reasons: \n \n It is often multidrug-resistant, meaning that it is resistant to multiple antifungal drugs commonly used to treat Candida infections. It is difficult to identify with standard laboratory methods, and it can be misidentified in labs without specific technology. Misidentification may lead to inappropriate management. It has caused outbreaks in healthcare settings. For this reason, it is important to quickly identify C. auris in a hospitalized patient so that healthcare facilities can take special precautions to stop its spread. \n \n CDC encourages all U.S. laboratory staff who identify C. auris to notify their state or local public health authorities and CDC at candidaauris@cdc.gov. \n \n CDC Expert Commentary\nSummary:\n", "response": "– The CDC warned American hospitals last year to keep an eye out for the emergence of a possibly fatal, drug-resistant yeast infection, and now the agency's fears may be realized. CDC officials tell the Washington Post that 35 patients in the US have been stricken with Candida auris, a fungus that can cause bloodstream, wound, and ear infections, with another 18 people harboring the microbe without becoming ill. Some strains of the pathogen don't respond to the three main classes of antifungal drugs, and based on the small number of cases health officials have had the chance to review, 60% of patients hit with C. auris have died (though the agency notes many of those patients had other serious medical issues they were contending with). The fungus is contagious and durable, especially in health care facilities, where it can stick around on furniture and other equipment for months. The first C. auris strain was reported in 2009 in a Japanese man, and it has since spread around the globe, including to Colombia, India, Israel, Kenya, Kuwait, Pakistan, South Korea, Venezuela, and the UK. The first US case was reported in 2013, and the CDC's latest report places 28 of the incidents in New York state, with other affected states including New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Illinois. CDC Acting Director Anne Schuchat said at a recent briefing that \"scary,\" \"difficult to combat\" drug-resistant microorganisms are on the rise, per the Post. Some good news is that C. auris hasn't morphed yet into new strains, and most people's chances of contracting it are very low, with it only affecting \"the sickest of the sick,\" says CDC infectious disease specialist Tom Chiller. Also encouraging: a recent study IDing an antifungal that may prove useful. (No drug could save this Nevada woman.)"}

Comey, the F.B.I. director he fired in anger over an investigation into his campaign’s possible ties to Russia. \n \n Meeting a self-imposed deadline of this week to resolve questions he himself raised by implying that he had taped Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he had not made tapes of what Mr. Comey has testified were attempts by the president to derail the Justice Department’s investigation. \n \n But if few people believed that Mr. Trump actually possessed recordings, his motives in warning Mr. Comey that he might have taped him remain a mystery, particularly since it set off a chain of events that accelerated, rather than slowed, the investigation into Mr. Trump and Russia. \n \n Mr. Comey testified that it was Mr. Trump’s veiled threat of tapes that led him to authorize the disclosure of memos of his conversations with the president — the details of which prompted the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel to look into the case.\nSummary:\n", "response": "– President Trump admitted Thursday he never recorded his conversations with fired FBI Director James Comey—more than a month after he implied he may have, the New York Times reports. \"With all of the recently reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking and illegal leaking of information, I have no idea ... whether there are 'tapes' or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings,\" Trump said in a series of tweets. Back on May 12, Trump had tweeted: \"James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!\" Trump's original tweet led to weeks of speculation that he was recording conversations in the Oval Office—despite multiple government agencies saying that wasn't the case, CNN reports. A senior administration official says Trump has been enjoying all the attention his talk of \"tapes\" has gotten—CNN notes he's been treating it \"like a game show reveal\"—but he probably shouldn't be. Comey testified that Trump's \"tapes\" tweet spurred him to leak a memo detailing a conversation with the president to the media.

Things didn’t work out so well for 18-year old Ezekiel Stevenson, the wannabe carjacker, because the driver of the car had a tiny advantage: the key fob. \n \n I have a sort of love/hate relationship with proximity keys.

See, when Stevenson dragged that unnamed guy out of his car, he had the key fob on him, so when the prison inmate tried to drive away, the car’s owner was able to shut down the car. \n \n With the car immobile, a standoff ensued, with Stevenson attempting to lock the doors, but the owner just kept clicking the button on the fob and unlocking them, over and over, until police were able to enter the car. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Stevenson bolted into the woods, but was caught within the hour.

The women say they saw Williams on the street around 2:30am Sunday and asked him to take a picture with them, but he got upset when they started filming him. He allegedly punched one woman and pointed a gun at the entire group. Police responded, and Williams told them the women were actually filming him without his consent and even grabbed a chain from around his neck, which he says is what started the fight; no one was arrested, but the incident is still under investigation. The lawyer also accused Williams of stealing the women's cellphones and says police should have done a more thorough investigation. Williams is also suspected of misdemeanor battery in Los Angeles on Tuesday, TMZ reports. Police say he got in a fight with onlookers at a car crash and punched somebody; Williams says he went to the scene of the accident to help, but the onlookers started making fun of him. When he told them to be quiet, he says, one of them struck him and he was just defending himself when he hit back. Williams had been released from jail in the Atlanta case, and was in LA Tuesday to appear in court for yet another past incident (perhaps this one?), TMZ reported prior to the car accident incident."}

Just a day after the attack, the CIA's reports were already referencing al-Qaeda in the Islamic Mahgreb. The following day, David Petraeus appeared before House and Senate groups; he, too, mentioned the terrorists, and was asked to compile unclassified talking points that Congress could use. By noon on Sept. 14, a draft was circulating—and it referenced al-Qaeda. But an exhausting process of editing followed, with more than two dozen CIA officials weighing in on the copy over email—and battling about the inclusion of al-Qaeda. Those opposed argued it should be removed because the intel was shaky (sourced from intercepted phone calls) and over fears it could alert al-Qaeda members to the fact that they were being watched. The opponents won out, though the term \"extremists\" remained; the FBI agreed with the call. It also contained this line: \"The demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the US Embassy in Cairo.\" On Sept. 15, the CIA station chief in Tripoli began to voice his concern with the assertions that the attack was both spontaneous and that demonstrations were occurring. He sent the CIA an email summarizing his thoughts the next day—but Susan Rice had already been hand-delivered the 94 fateful words the night before, so that she could prep for her news show appearances.

TMZ has learned. \n \n Rodman was driving in Newport Beach Saturday at around 11 PM when cops pulled him over for a traffic violation. Cops administered a field sobriety test, which he flunked. He was handcuffed, put in a patrol car and taken to the police station. \n \n We're told Rodman was cooperative and submitted to a breathalyzer test, and he blew over the .08 legal limit. \n \n Rodman remained in jail for 7 hours, and when police determined he was sober enough to care for himself he was released. \n \n Rodman was busted for DUI back in 1999.\nSummary:\n", "response": "– Dennis Rodman was pulled over late Saturday in Southern California, where police allege he was driving under the influence. USA Today reports the five-time NBA championship winner was first stopped by cops in Newport Beach around 11pm for vehicle code violations before officers began a DUI investigation. According to reports, Rodman was given a breathalyzer test before being arrested and booked into Newport Beach Jail. The legal limit in California is .08, but police did not release Rodman's test results. TMZ reports the 56-year-old was cooperative and that he remained in custody for seven hours before officials determined he'd sobered up enough to go home. Rodman was previously arrested on DUI charges in 1999 and 2003. \"Alcoholism has been a struggle on and off for Dennis the past 15 years,\" a rep for Rodman told TMZ on Sunday. Rodman retired in 2000 after 14 seasons in the NBA. More recently, he's made headlines for his unlikely bond with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Just last month, the LA Times reported that Rodman wanted to arrange a diplomatic basketball game between North Korea and Guam, a US territory. “The people in Guam are all about it. They love it,\" he said while on what he called a \"humanitarian\" tour of Asia aimed at bridging the rift in US-DPRK relations. With President Trump and Kim Jong Un trading fiery rhetoric, Rodman used the occasion of his fifth and most recent North Korea visit to present a state official with a copy of Trump's The Art of the Deal in June."}

In effect, the measure would sharply limit Mr. Trump’s ability to suspend or lift sanctions on Russia — handcuffing a sitting president just six months into his term with the nearly unanimous support of a Republican-led Congress. \n \n The Trump administration has opposed the sanctions against Russia, arguing that it needs flexibility to pursue a more collaborative diplomacy with a country that, by American intelligence consensus, interfered in last year’s presidential election. But now the president faces a decision he had hoped to avoid, even though the administration supports sanctions against Iran and North Korea. \n \n White House aides have acknowledged privately that a veto would be politically awkward, at best, for Mr. Trump to justify during the continuing investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Russia.\nSummary:\n", "response": "– The Senate voted 98 to 2 to approve new sanctions on Russia early Friday, and payback was swift: Russia's Foreign Ministry announced within hours that it is reducing the number of US diplomats in Russia as of Sept 1. and shutting down the US Embassy's recreational retreat, near Moscow, the AP reports. At a press conference before the retaliatory measures were announced, Vladimir Putin said Russia had behaved in a very \"restrained and patient\" way, but would have to respond to sanctions at some point, reports the Guardian. \"It's impossible to endlessly tolerate this kind of insolence towards our country,\" Putin said. \"This practice is unacceptable—it destroys international relations and international law.\" The Senate sanctions measure followed the House's passing of sanctions by an overwhelming 419-3 margin. The sanctions target Russia for interfering in the 2016 US election and for military aggression in Ukraine and Syria. The measure will severely limit President Trump's ability to suspend sanctions, and it's not clear whether he will sign it, though fellow Republicans including Sen. John McCain have urged him not to reject a measure with veto-proof bipartisan support, reports the New York Times. \"We will not tolerate attacks on our democracy.

(The Telegraph notes that the European average is 40.5 inches.) According to her lawyer, a rep for Elite told Marchildon that “although she has a nice face, she has a fat ass” and that “she never had it in her to become a top model because she was unsuitable for catwalk work.” But Elite says Marchildon simply could not get modeling jobs because of her size: \"Couture clothing is made in one size only: (très très) petite.

Homme co-wrote the theme to Bourdain’s CNN program “Parts Unknown,” and appeared on an episode of the preceding television show “No Reservations.” In a sketch from the latter show, Bourdain walks up to Homme while he’s playing a guitar and singing, seizing the guitar and smashing it against a tree.

Pitchfork reports the rocker was close with Bourdain and helped write the theme to Parts Unknown. He also made an appearance on an episode of No Reservations, and a scene during the opening of the show apparently upset Homme's young daughter. In it, Bourdain interrupts a singing Homme, seizes his guitar, and smashes it against a tree. Homme took to Twitter Thursday to share the letter Bourdain subsequently sent a \"so mad\" Camille. \"You, with great care, such empathy, such sweetness ... you apologized to a little girl who was defending her daddy,\" Homme wrote. \"Ariane [that's Bourdain's daughter], this was your father.\" The letter reads in part, \"Know that that was in fact not really Daddy's guitar, and that we were both just playing around. Daddy would have been very angry were I to do such a thing—and as he is a large man, I would not still be here to write this letter. I like your Daddy very much. We are friends.\" Another portion reads, \"I like your Daddy so much, that when an obnoxious superfan of mine ... got in your Daddy’s face—had your Daddy not gently guided him by the thorax to the welcoming arms of security—I would have broken my beer glass across the man's skull and then jabbed the jagged remnants into his ****ing neck. That’s the kind of guy I am. I had your Daddy’s back—just like he had mine. You will learn about these things later—possibly in grammar school.\" Read the letter in full here.

From there, he has the accounts tweet, retweet, follow, and message—all in the name of clients like \"Rapper/Singer/Producer/Guitarist/Fitness Model\" Dave Murrell aka @Fyrare (number of Twitter followers: 238,360). Murrell has tried Twitter ads, but says he gets more bang for his buck with Vidmar. Murrell doesn't exactly express any qualms: \"If you're not padding your numbers, you're not doing it right. It's part of the game.\" And it's not just follower count that can be affected: Client Tony Benson (aka rapper Philly Chase) says Vidmar's fake accounts pushed him onto the \"trending topics\" list and eventually sparked the noticed of Philadelphia media. Buying and selling both accounts and followers is, of course, barred by Twitter's terms of service, but Vidmar notes he has never been contacted or threatened with legal action by Twitter."}

And the number of Americans who engaged in not a single one of those 104 activities in all of 2014 is more than one in four of us: That's 83 million people, or 28% of the US population over the age of 6, reports the Wall Street Journal. \"We feel confident, in a sad way, that this is the largest number we’ve ever seen,\" says PAC member and Sports and Fitness Industry Association exec Tom Cove, who adds it's the most dismal result he's seen in 24 years. The number of completely sedentary Americans increased by 18% since 2007. That's not to say we don't like the appearance of fitness, just the actuality of it: The Journal notes the rise of \"athleisure\" apparel; such footwear saw sales jump 8% in the year ending April 11, while performance shoes took an 18% dive. The PAC traces the decline to our schools, which help form our lifelong fitness habits and where kids are spending less time in gym class and recess. Another problem? The increasingly cutthroat nature of sports is forcing more casual athletes to the sidelines. Says Cove: \"There are way too many kids who leave sports at age 9, 10, 11, because they simply have to make a decision: Am I going to be a travel soccer kid and devote my life to this, or are there other things that I want to do?\" (An editorial argues that it's not lack of exercise causing an obesity epidemic, it's the food industry's unhealthy products.)"}

It's unclear how long after that final approval would come. The move comes amidst a rapidly changing legal landscape around online gambling. Nevada became the first state to legalize online poker earlier this year. Though it has handed out a few licenses already, none of the companies' online poker games is up and running yet.

To make its Pulitzer dreams come true, the Onion has enlisted the completely independent and not at all biased nonprofit group Americans for Fairness in Awarding Journalism Prizes, which declares: “Simply put, it’s time for the Pulitzer Board to stop the bias, stop the ignorance, and stop the neglect.” The Onion also claims such diverse supporters as Arianna Huffington (for real) and the president of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili (maybe not so real).

Pointing to Muhammad's repeated references to \"white devils\" and \"Yakub\" — the villainous figure responsible for creating white people, according to Nation of Islam lore — Levin said it is likely Muhammad thought he was taking part in a race war against whites.\nSummary:\n", "response": "– The man accused of murdering four white men in Fresno—three of them in a Tuesday morning shooting spree—repeatedly referred to \"white devils\" in online postings. Police believe 39-year-old Kori Ali Muhammad's killing spree was a hate crime, not an act of terrorism. The suspect's father, Vincent Taylor, tells the Los Angeles Times that his son believed black people and white people were at war and \"a battle was about to take place.\" Police say Muhammed, who surrendered peacefully after shooting the three men, has told them he decided to kill \"as many people as he could\" after he was identified as a suspect in the fatal shooting of a Motel 6 security guard last week, the Fresno Bee reports. Taylor says he's glad his son—who changed his name from Kori Taylor—was arrested and the bloodshed is at an end. Muhammad's other online postings include a rap album with the lyrics: \"Hollow points make a white devil body spin.\" Police say his victims included Pacific Gas & Electric Co. employee Zackary Randalls, the 34-year-old father of two young children. The two other men killed Tuesday are believed to be clients of Catholic Charities, an organization that helps the poor and the homeless, the Bee reports. Police say Muhammad shouted \"Allahu akbar\" as he was arrested. Leaders from several Fresno Muslim centers joined Christian and Jewish leaders outside City Hall Tuesday to condemn the killings."}

After being tagged with a transmitter by research organization Ocearch back in 2012 off the coast of Cape Cod, Mary Lee gained a legion of loyal followers tracking her ocean journeys. (She has nearly 130,000 Twitter followers.) However, no ping has been registered since June, reports the Post and Courier of Charleston, SC. The good news is that this doesn't necessarily mean the end of Mary Lee: Chris Fischer of Ocearch tells Jacksonville.com that it's more likely the batteries in her transmitter, designed to last about five years, have finally given out. Fischer hopes to see Mary Lee again, but is OK if that never happens. “I feel like she’s done so much, it’s hard to ask for anything else,” he says. “For any individual shark, she’s undone more of the damage from Jaws than any shark in history, and she’s the most famous shark in history.” Mary Lee was 40 or 50 years old when first tagged, so Fischer figures she has another 20 years of life. Meanwhile, boaters and fishermen are being asked to keep an eye out, particularly off the coast of South Carolina. The 16-foot shark just happens to have a distinctive bite mark in her dorsal fin, raising hopes that if she is still swimming around out there, somebody will spot her."}

Purvis writes that her doctors initially thought the cysts \"were of no concern\" and were even \"getting smaller.\" Immediately after birth, two sizable tumors and much of Purvis' ovaries were removed, and even then \"we were initially assured that it would most likely not be anything to worry about.\" The prognosis came back four weeks later: ovarian cancer. Though it was a rare form, Purvis learned that the rate of successful treatment is \"higher.\" What followed was chemotherapy—four rounds, with two more to come.

Here's the deal: last week's episode (which you can see a clip of here) mocked the taboo against showing the prophet Mohammed, having him show up first hidden inside a U-Haul, and then inside a bear costume. This week's episode was to continue that story. It's unclear whether the extra censorship is intended to appease the irony-challenged folks at RevolutionMuslim or mock them.

A British cafe has introduced the queen of all breakfasts, a 59-item spread that packs in 7,778 calories. The Corner Cafe's Monster Mega Breakfast comes across as slightly redundant: It contains eggs and omelets, fried potatoes (four portions) and hash browns, and both toast and fried bread. Plus bacon, sausages, mushrooms, chips, onion rings, black pudding, tomatoes, and beans. The meal costs about $22.50 and has a time limit attached: Those attempting to polish it off have an hour to do so if they want to win a place on the wall of champions, a breakfast coupon, and a key ring. They'll be helped (or hindered?) along the way with one of two drinks: their choice of a milkshake or energy drink, reports the Bristol Post. A manager of the Portishead cafe tells the Post that since being launched earlier this month, five people have ordered it and none have finished. Quirky side note: No one under 18 is allowed to order it. The cafe's Facebook page has photos of those who have made the attempt, along with a message to those who have accused it of being wasteful. Its post begins, \"We are just a little family run business who can't save the entire world from famine and starvation!\" Could the 8,000-calorie breakfast be the start of a trend? The Bear Grills cafe in Congleton, England, made a splash a few months ago with the launch of its own 8,000-calorie meal, the 7-pound \"Hibernator.\" Sweet tooths may prefer its version, which includes four waffles.

That would indicate it could go public within the first three months of next year. Uber declined to comment on the Journal report. Uber's advisers have suggested the company could get a valuation of $120 billion; its latest valuation was $76 billion when it sold about a $500 million stake to Toyota in August. The filing would come on the heels of a similar move by Uber's smaller rival Lyft. The two initial public offerings could raise billions for the two companies to fuel their expansions, while giving investors their first chance to buy stakes in the ride-hailing phenomenon.

Lynne DiSanto of Box Elder shared a meme Sept. 7 depicting stick-figure protesters being hit by an SUV. It was posted less than a month after a driver hit counter-protesters at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing a woman. DiSanto told the Rapid City Journal she should have taken that into consideration, and doesn't condone protesters being hit by vehicles. The Journal reports the image, which was taken down Tuesday, bore three phrases: \"All Lives Splatter,\" \"Nobody cares about your protest\" and \"Keep your (expletive) out of the road.\" DiSanto tacked on her own comment: \"I think this is a movement we can all support. #alllivessplatter.\" She tells the Journal that she's \"sorry if people took offense to it,\" because in her view, it wasn't offensive. \"I perceived it differently. I perceived it as encouraging people to stay out of the street.\" Keller Williams Realty Black Hills, the real estate company that apparently employed DiSanto, posted on Facebook she's no longer with the firm. House Majority Leader Lee Qualm tells the AP the incident won't affect DiSanto's position as House majority whip."}

So she did what any normal human would do and released her own nude pictures. Bridget Marquardt: Bizarrely, even one of Hugh Hefner's own girlfriends couldn't get her own solo spread in the magazine. After she failed her test shoots, Hef invited Marquardt to become one of the Girls Next Door, and she did at least end up in a group spread with her co-girlfriends. t.A.T.u.: If you've forgotten who this duo is, just recall 1990s hit \"All the Things She Said.\" They got rejected from not one, but two editions of Playboy, the American one and the German one. LuAnn de Lesseps: She definitely seemed upset when fellow Real Housewife of NYC Kelly Bensimon was asked to pose in the mag, and responded with, \"No one asked me!\" She later claimed she didn't really want to be in Playboy anyway (and you'll notice she never was). Audrina Patridge: The Hills reality star reportedly had topless pictures taken to submit to Playboy, but got turned down ... and somehow, the photos were \"accidentally\" leaked.

No one could be this stupid twice.\nSummary:\n", "response": "– It appears Kenneth Cole didn't learn his lesson when he sent a very questionable tweet out into the world to promote his brand back in 2011. He's done it once again, this time using the situation in Syria, rather than Egypt, for inspiration, Gawker notes. \"'Boots on the ground' or not, let's not forget about sandals, pumps and loafers. #Footwear,\" the high-end designer tweeted yesterday. And out poured the angry responses. One Twitter user argued Cole was \"mocking war to sell fashion,\" another accused him of being \"out for cheap shock value.\" But this time around, Cole isn't apologizing. In an Instagram video, the designer responded by saying, \"I've always used my platform to provoke dialogue about important issues including HIV/AIDS, war, and homelessness. I'm well aware of the risks that come with this approach, and if this encourages further awareness and discussion of critical issues, then all the better.\" But as the Atlantic Wire notes, \"If Cole is genuine about the mission behind his otherwise regrettable tweets, it doesn't look like he's anywhere close to succeeding: The only subject his more controversial tweets have provoked people to discuss is Kenneth Cole himself.\" Click to find out why he's in teachers' bad books, too."}

McIntosh lives in Tampa, Florida, but his mother-in-law in Texas, Trudy Lampson, owns the nursing home and sent the image to him and his wife.

A total Witch Hunt! MUST END NOW!\nSummary:\n", "response": "– House Intelligence Committee Republicans have released their final findings on Russian interference in the 2016 US election, ending a yearlong probe, per the Washington Post. The heavily redacted 253-page report puts President Trump and his cohorts generally in the clear, noting the panel found \"no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded, coordinated, or conspired with the Russian government.\" What it did find was that the Obama administration dropped the ball with a \"slow and inconsistent\" response to the Russians, and that both the Trump and Clinton campaigns showed \"poor judgment and ill-considered actions.\" The report, which was said to be based on interviews with nearly 75 witnesses and a scouring of hundreds of thousands of documents, also concludes that any attempts of Trump associates to try to forge a relationship with Russia were either unsanctioned by Trump or didn't pan out. But the New York Times notes that Democratic committee members, who didn't endorse the report, have said their GOP colleagues didn't probe as deeply as they should have and wrapped up investigative efforts early to help shield the president from any trouble. A nearly 100-page Democratic rebuttal to the GOP's report says \"a majority\" of its findings are “misleading and unsupported by the facts and the investigative record,\" per the Post. Trump immediately jumped on the announcement, tweeting just minutes after the news broke: \"Just Out: House Intelligence Committee Report released.
